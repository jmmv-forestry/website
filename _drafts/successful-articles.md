Over the 11 years I have been blogging, I have only had a bunch of
what-*I*-consider-to-be successful articles and those happened only in
the last few years. A small part of this is because I have improved my
writing skills, but a larger part of this is because I have **started
paying attention to what works and what does not**.

> **Based on my personal preferences and goals, I define successful

> and/or those that spur insightful discussion.**

I haven't had a ton of successful articles so far, but I have had a fair
share of them to start noticing patterns. Ergo I'd like to share my
experience on this topic in this post and I'll do so by "article type".
In doing so, I'll cross-reference other articles of mine with a
rationale behind their "performance".

One caveat: I'm looking at the performance of individual articles, not
necessarily how they have caused the readers to "convert" and follow my
site more closely. The latter is also an important thing to track, but I
haven't done much of it yet.

# i) Articles of the form "how to do X"

These are the articles that present, step-by-step, how to achieve a
technical goal or how to do something. These articles are rarely
successful at launch because they do not provide incentives for people
to share them but, if they are good, they will bring traffic over time.

The key is to get these articles indexed and highly ranked on popular
search engines, and if they show up on the first page of the search
results, they will be read a lot. However, one other thing I have
noticed is that the people reading these articles won't stay around:
they will get the information they were looking for, leave, and never
come back again.

A couple of examples from my recollection:

-   [How to merge multiple Git repositories]({% post_url
    2014-02-15-how-to-merge-multiple-git-repositories %})
    (2014&ndash;02&ndash;15)

    This one gets a decent amount of organic traffic because Google
    shows this on the first or second results pages of common searches
    related to this topic.

-   [Get a handle on email subscriptions]({% post_url
    2015-06-06-get-a-handle-on-email-subscriptions %})
    (2015&ndash;06&ndash;06)

    This one was not successful despite the many hours I invested in it.
    Now that I think about it, it might be the title's fault because it
    does not lend itself to being discovered: you won't search for this
    content with the keywords in the title; you will search with
    questions of the form "how to manage email subscriptions".

# ii) Articles reviewing a bunch of "products"

These are the articles that survey a collection of related products, be
them physical or virtual. Similarly to the previous article, these seem
to work well long-term once they have been indexed by a search engine.

The obvious and maybe only example from my collection:

-   [Putting a PowerMac G5 to good use]({% post_url
    2013-07-15-putting-powermac-g5-to-good-use %})
    (2013&ndash;07&ndash;15)

    This article has gotten more than 26,000 visits and is one of the
    most visited article from my old blog. The traffic is incremental
    though, and having more than 20K visits does not make this a
    particularly successful article considering that those visits have
    been piling up for more than two years.

# iii) Articles telling a story about something I have done

These are the articles that explain something I have recently done and
that I found interesting enough to share. These work slightly better
than the "how to do X" type of articles, but only if your followers are
passionate about what you have done. Those readers will often "like" or
"favorite" or "+1" the post, but not really reshare it.

Some examples:

-   [Introducing the FreeBSD Test Suite]({% post_url
    2013-12-31-introducing-freebsd-test-suite %})
    (2013&ndash;12&ndash;31)

# iv) Articles telling a story of personal work practices

Things are getting interesting here. These are the articles that explain
personal preferences on how to do something, not just the actual,
objective process. These do much better, and I think this is the case
because they offer a unique perspective on the topic.

I'll theorize that people seem to like reading opinions and personal
practices because theirs are often different, and seeing the point of
view of others' is valuable.

Some examples:

-   [Task tracking and the Bullet Journal]({% post_url
    2014-11-20-task-tracking-and-bullet-journal %})
    (2014&ndash;11&ndash;20)

    This article got significant attention, especially from the Bullet
    Journal community in Google+. It was somewhat unexpected because
    this was an article "out of the ordinary" for my site, as I was
    covering a topic I had never touched before.

-   [Code review culture meets FreeBSD]({% post_url
    2014-05-31-code-review-culture-meets-freebsd %})
    (2014&ndash;05&ndash;31)

-   [My coding workflow]({% post_url 2015-09-08-my-coding-workflow %})
    (2015&ndash;09&ndash;08)

# v) Articles explaining a personal opinion

These are the killer articles. These are the articles that present a
topic and then go on to describe my personal point of view. These get
attention and get shared, especially when the topic being covered is
polarizing.

-   [Hello, Medium!]({% post_url 2015-05-24-hello-medium %})
    (2015&ndash;05&ndash;24)

-   [Self-interview after leaving the NetBSD Board]({% post_url
    2013-06-20-self-interview-after-leaving-netbsd %})
    (2013&ndash;06&ndash;20)

-   [On Bazel and Open Source]({% post_url
    2015-04-14-on-bazel-and-open-source %})
    (2015&ndash;04&ndash;14)

-   [Compilers in the (BSD) base system]({% post_url
    2015-10-23-compilers-in-the-bsd-base-system %})
    (2015&ndash;10&ndash;23)

# Things that haven't worked

A quick search on-line will reveal plenty of articles giving advice on
how to write top posts, and the advice tends to overlap. I have given
those tips a try and did not find them to benefit my posts. In
particular:

- A publishing schedule. During 2013, I ran posts a couple of times a week on a
  predictable schedule, which resulted in the creation of a *Series section* in
  my blog. Despite the schedule and all the work involved in keeping up with it,
  I did not notice any increase in returning visitors to my site. It might be
  because the content was not worth it, or because the presentation was not
  amenable. I don't know.

- Images. Adding images to your posts makes them more shareable-friendly because
  all major social sites will display one of your images along with your post,
  giving it a more prominent look in their stream. Many of my popular posts from
  the above list do not have images, and the ones I added images to did not
  always yield any better results.

Note that I *do* believe that these tips are helpful and that they
result in better posts and a better site. However, they may just be
prerequisites for delivering nicer content, and, by themselves, won't
attract traffic.
