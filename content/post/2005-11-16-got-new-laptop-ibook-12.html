I never blogged about this before, but around six months ago, I bought a second-hand iBook 14", G3 at 600Mhz with 256Mb of RAM. The machine has served me very well during this time although I felt its slowliness (specially under <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>) to do common tasks: buildling stuff (university projects) and composing documents under <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>.  I also felt its weight when carrying it on my backback.<br /><br />However, a friend of mine offered to buy it for a reasonable price some days ago... so I decided to sell it and buy a shiny new one. And this is what I've just done: gone to the closest Apple Store and bought an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a> 12" (G4 at 1.33Ghz, 1Gb of RAM, and 40Gb of hard disk). Less weight, faster and nicer :-)<br /><br />I'll keep using Mac OS X for a while in this computer. I want the laptop to do real work and not fight setting it up (as used to happen in the previous one with <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a>. Of course, I'll try them some day (or, at the very least, <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>), but when I have more free time; I'm very busy these days with some university stuff (and I needed a faster laptop to get this work done).<br /><br />Now, to explore it a bit more! :-)
