<p>More or less a month ago, the first part of my <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/03/31/packaging.html">Making packager-friendly software</a> article was published at <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp.com</a>. I was happy to receive comments from several people saying that they liked it (sorry if I haven't replied to you yet; I've been very busy during the past few weeks).</p>  <p>Now it's the time for the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/04/28/packaging2.html">second (and last) part</a>, which has just seen the light. It deals with recursive dependencies, handling of configuration files, unprivileged builds, the make utility, build infrastructure oddities and some details about code portability. I hope you enjoy it and try to make your projects a bit more packager-friendly in the future! ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
