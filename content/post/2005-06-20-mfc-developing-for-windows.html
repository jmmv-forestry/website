<p>During the past two days, I've been working (again) on my <a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostProcess">Boost Process library</a> idea.  While doing so, I realized that I don't know anything at all about coding for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows</a> using the MFC. I must learn how to handle processes under this platform to be able to design a correct abstraction layer for process management.</p>  <p>It's time to do so.  I booted Windows XP, downloaded <a href="http://www.borland.com/">Borland</a>'s C++ Builder 5 command line tools (that is, the C++ <i>free</i> compiler) and installed it following the instructions (not a "trivial" task).  Man, it's damn fast compared to <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU g++</a>, as seen while building some <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>'s code.</p>  <p>After this, I was was shown with the task to write a little Windows program.  The only thing I knew was that they use a <tt>WinMain</tt> function rather than a <tt>main</tt> one, so this was the starting point. I looked for some documentation and finally came up with an extremely simple, useless and stupid command line program:</p>  <pre>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;<br /><br />int WINAPI<br />WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance,<br />       HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,<br />       LPSTR lpCmdLine,<br />       int nCmdShow)<br />{<br />   return 0;<br />}</pre><p></p>  <p>You see, all it does is return success. Building it was simple after some digging of the compiler options, but it took some time too. Doing <tt>bcc32.exe -tW test.cpp</tt> resulted in a <tt>test.exe</tt> file ready to be executed.  I also tried some <tt>CreateProcess</tt> example I found, but I won't comment it yet since I still don't understand it perfectly.</p>  <p>I'll keep learning stuff during the following days, so expect more posts along the lines of this one. However, I don't know how much time I'll have to devote to Boost.Process: I applied for <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Google's summer of code</a>, so in case I get picked, I'll have to work on my project rather than on anything else ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
