<p>I have imported the preliminar sources of <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/vcsme/">VCS Made Easy</a> into the repository; you can view them trough ViewCVS by clicking <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/vcsme/">here</a>.  To download them, just follow the regular procedure for any project hosted at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge.net</a>, which is summarized here:</p>  <pre>$ mkdir vcsme<br />$ cd vcsme<br />$ cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vcsme<br />   login<br />$ cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/vcsme<br />   co -P src</pre><p></p>  <p>The status of this code is close to a possible 0.1 release, although it still lacks some important features and cleanups: for example, it doesn't work very well if you don't have a previous <tt>.cvsrc</tt> file. I will be more confident to publish it when it works correctly out of the box for a completely clean user acount. But for now, you can play with the code in the repository.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
