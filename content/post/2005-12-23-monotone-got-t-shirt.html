The last weekend of past November, <a href="http://www.venge.net/">Monotone</a>'s main author, Graydon Hoare, proposed a "bugathon": a time frame in which all efforts could be focused on fixing existing bugs in the code.  The price for solving a bug was a T-Shirt (or any other object from its <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/monotone_vcs">CafePress shop</a>), so I decided to help a bit by fixing some portability bugs to <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a>.  And today, I received the long sleeved T-Shirt I ordered in exchange for the fixes :-)  (Will post a photo of this one too when I learn how to do it.)
