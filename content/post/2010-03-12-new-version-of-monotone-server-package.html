Wow, it has been a long time... 5 years ago, I created the <a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/monotone-server/?only_with_tag=MAIN">monotone-server</a> package in pkgsrc, a package that provided an interactive script to set up a <a href="http://monotone.ca/">monotone</a> server from scratch with, what I though, minimal hassle.<br /><br />My package did the job just fine, but past year I was blown away by the simplicity of the same package in <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>: their <tt>init.d</tt> script provides a set of extra commands to initialize the server before starting it up, and that is it. No need to mess with a separate interactive script; no need to create and memorize passphrases that you will never use; and, what's more, all integrated in the only single place that makes sense: in the init.d "service management" script.<br /><br />It has been a while since I became jealous of their approach, but I've finally got to it: I've spent the last few days rewriting the monotone-server package in pkgsrc and came up with a similar scheme.  And this <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2010/03/12/msg038844.html">new package</a> just made its way <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2010/03/12/msg038844.html"></a>to pkgsrc-HEAD!  The new package comes with what I think is a detailed manual page that explains how to configure the server from scratch.  Take a look and, if you find any mistakes, inconsistencies or improvements to be done, let me know!<br /><br />In the meantime, I will log into my home server, rebuild the updated package and put it in production :-)
