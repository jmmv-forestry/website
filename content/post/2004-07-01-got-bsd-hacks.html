<p>I've just got a copy of the recently published <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/bsdhks">BSD Hacks</a> book, by Dru Lavigne.  Back in February, I wrote two little hacks (specially addressed to the book), titled "<i>Log a headless server remotely</i>" and "<i>Automate NetBSD package builds</i>", that were added to it.  Wow, I'm really happy to see the printed results :-)</p>  <p>After I've read it entirely, I'll post another message with my impressions.  Just to say that it looks promising.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
