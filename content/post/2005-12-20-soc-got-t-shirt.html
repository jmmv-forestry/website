When I got home yesterday, I found that I had already received the so-promised <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'s Summer of Code T-Shirt as well as a certificate stating that I passed the program.  I'm happy :-)  I now should learn how to post photos here in <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>.
