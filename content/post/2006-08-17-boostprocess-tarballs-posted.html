As everybody is not comfortable accessing Subversion repositories to download source code, I've posted two tarballs with Boost.Process' sources.  They include an exported copy of the repository contents as well as prebuilt documentation in the <tt>libs/process/doc/html</tt> subdirectory.<br /><br />You can download the compressed archive either in <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/process.tar.gz">tar.gz</a> format or in <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/process.zip">ZIP</a>.  Keep in mind that these will be updated very frequently so please do not use them to prepackage the library.<br /><br />Changes from yesterday's announcement are minor at this point.  For the curious ones: there is now a list of <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/process/boost_process/pending_work.html">pending work</a> and the <i>Last revised</i> item in the main page has been fixed.  As a side effect of this last change, Boostbook will support SVN's <tt>$Date$</tt> tags if <a href="http://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2006/08/109248.php">my patch</a> is integrated :-)
