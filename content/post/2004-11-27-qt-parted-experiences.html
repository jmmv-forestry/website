<p>A few days ago I gave <a href="http://qtparted.sourceforge.net/">QT Parted</a> a try (from a <a href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix 3.6</a> disk): I shrinked my NTFS partition to leave more room for other OSes (not that space is a problem here, but I wanted to try it). The program is awesome: very easy to use (looks a lot like Partition Magic) and it did the job quickly and correctly.</p>  <p>However, yesterday's evening I tried the same but with a ReiserFS partition. In few minutes, the partition was shrinked to half of its original size. Afterwards I tried to mount it, still from within Knoppix. Everything seemed to be OK.</p>  <p>But it was not so nice as I expected.  I rebooted into my <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> system... and <tt>fsck.reiserfs</tt> was started.  Lots of errors flooded the screen, just to tell me a bit later to fix the errors manually.</p>  <p>Got to the console (which still worked), tried another fsck and got the same errors. Now I noticed a suggestion that told me to try the <tt>--rebuild-tree</tt> flag. Oh, it may fix it... so I tried. The process seemed to go fine, but things got only worse. After a reboot, nothing worked; even <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub">GNU GRUB</a> failed to read its <tt>stage2</tt> correctly.</p>  <p>So I gave up.  I had nothing important in the partition aside <tt>apt</tt>'s cache (not a problem since I've already downloaded everything again).  From now on I'll continue to keep my <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a> installations under Ext2 (or maybe Ext3), mainly because they can be read (and written!) without problems from <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>.  And they can be safely resized (I can always go back to Partition Magic 5), in case I want to try another OS.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
