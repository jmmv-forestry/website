<a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">The NetBSD Project</a> has just released a new major version of its operating system, thus making <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Releases/formal-3/">NetBSD 3.0</a>.  This release comes a year after of 2.0 publication and includes lots of new features and bug fixes.  For more information, see the <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/Releases/formal-3/NetBSD-3.0.html">announcement</a> (also available in <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/es/Releases/formal-3/NetBSD-3.0.html">Spanish</a>).<br /><br />From here, a big thank you to all the people who made this release possible and, specially, to the release engineering team.
