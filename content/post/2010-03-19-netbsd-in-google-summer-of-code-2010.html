For the 6th year in a row, <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> is a mentoring organization for <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> 2010!<br /><br />If you are a bright student willing to develop full-time for an open source project during this coming summer, consider applying with us! You will have a chance to work with very smart people and, most likely, in the area that you are most passionate about. NetBSD, being an operating system project, has offers for project ideas at all levels: from the kernel to the packaging system, passing by drivers, networking tools, user-space utilities, the system installer, automation tools and more!<br /><br />I would like to point you at the 3 project proposals I'm willing to directly mentor:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-projects.html#optimize-atf">Optimize and speed-up ATF</a>: Make the testing framework blazing fast so that running the NetBSD automated tests does not take ages on slow platforms.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-projects.html#reorganize-atf">Reorganize ATF to improve modularity</a>: Refactor pieces of the testing framework so that it is easier to redistribute, has cleaner interfaces and is easier to depend on from third-party projects.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-projects.html#rewrite-pkg_comp">Rewrite pkg_comp with portability as a major goal</a>: Use Python to create a tool to automatically build binary packages from within a sandbox.</li></ul>If you find any of the above projects interesting, or if you have any other project proposal that you think I could mentor, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:jmmv%20at%20netbsd%20dot%20org">contact me</a>. Feel free to send me a draft of <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-application.html">your application</a>, together with a bit of information about you, so that we can discuss your proposal and make sure it gets selected!<br /><br />Or, if none of the projects above interests you, please do check out the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-projects.html">full list of NetBSD project proposals</a>. I'm sure you will find something that suits your interests :-)
