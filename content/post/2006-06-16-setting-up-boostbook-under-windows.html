In order to have a complete development environment for my SoC project under Windows, I still had to install and configure <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boostbook.html">BoostBook</a>.  Why I want this is beyond the aim of this post, but for the curious ones: my NetBSD setup is severely broken and I want to be able to work on documentation when I will be doing the Win32 part.<br /><br />I have spent a lot of time to get BoostBook properly configured, although now that I know the appropriate path it is quite simple.  Let's see how.<br /><br />First of all, you need to have xsltproc in Windows.  "Easy", I thought; "I can install it through Cygwin".  It wasn't that nice when I started to see bash crashing during installation, probably due to some Vista-related issue.  I discarded Cygwin and soon after discovered some prebuilt, standalone binaries that made the task a lot easier.<br /><br />So, the required steps are:<br /><ol><li>Get the iconv, zlib, libxml2 and libxslt <a href="http://www.zlatkovic.com/pub/libxml/">binary packages</a> made by Igor Zlatkovic.</li><li>Unpack all these packages in the same directory so that you get unique <tt>bin</tt>, <tt>include</tt> and <tt>lib</tt> directories within the hierarchy.  I used <tt>C:UsersjmmvDocumentsboostxml</tt> as the root for all files.</li><li>Go to the <tt>bin</tt> directory and launch <tt>xsltproc.exe</tt>.  It should just work.<br /></li><li>Download <a href="http://www.docbook.org/xml/4.2/docbook-xml-4.2.zip">Docbook XML 4.2</a> and unpack it; for example, in the same directory as above.  In my case I used <tt>C:UsersjmmvDocumentsboostxmldocbook-xml</tt>.</li><li>Download the latest <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=21935&package_id=16608">Docbook XSL</a> version and unpack it; you can use the same root directory used previously.  To make things easier, rename the directory created during the extraction to <tt>docbook-xsl</tt> (bypassing the version name).  Here I have: <tt>C:UsersjmmvDocumentsboostxmldocbook-xsl</tt>.</li><li>Add the following to your <tt>user-config.jam</tt> file, which probably lives in your home directory (<tt>%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%</tt>).  You must already have it, or otherwise you could not be building Boost.<br /><br /><tt>using xsltproc : "C:/Users/jmmv/Documents/boost/xml/bin/xsltproc.exe" ;</tt><br /><br /><tt>using boostbook</tt><br /><tt>    : "C:/Users/jmmv/Documents/boost/xml/docbook-xsl"</tt><br /><tt>    : "C:/Users/jmmv/Documents/boost/xml/docbook-xml"</tt><br /><tt>    ;</tt><br /><br />Adjust the paths as appropriate.</li></ol>As you can see, it is quite simple.  Just keep one thing in mind: if you try to build some documents and the process breaks due to misconfiguration, be sure to delete any <tt>bin</tt> and <tt>bin.v2</tt> directories generated by the build before you try again.  Otherwise your configuration changes will not take any effect.  This is what made me lose a <i>lot</i> of time because, although I had already fixed the configuration problems, they were not being honored!<br /><br />For more information, check out the official documentation about <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/html/boostbook/setup/manual.html">manual setup</a>.
