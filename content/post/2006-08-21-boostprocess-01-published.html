SoC 2006 is officially over &mdash; at least for me in my timezone.  Given that the Subversion repository has some problems with public access, I've tagged the current sources as the first public version and uploaded a couple of tarballs to the <a href="http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?">Boost Vault</a>.  Both the tag and the tarballs will also serve historical purposes, specially when newer ones come ;-)<br /><br />You can download the archives from the <a href="http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?&direction=0&amp;order=&directory=Process">Process</a> directory in <a href="http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?action=downloadfile&amp;filename=process-0.1.tar.gz&directory=Process&amp;">tar.gz</a> and <a href="http://boost-consulting.com/vault/index.php?action=downloadfile&filename=process-0.1.zip&amp;directory=Process&">ZIP</a> formats.  Enjoy!
