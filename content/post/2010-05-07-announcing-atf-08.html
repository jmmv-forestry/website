Looks like today is a release day.  I've just pushed <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20100507-atf-0-8-released">ATF 0.8</a> out in the wild and will proceed to import it into pkgsrc and NetBSD later.  Refer to the release announcement for details.  This is an exciting release!  You have been warned ;-)
