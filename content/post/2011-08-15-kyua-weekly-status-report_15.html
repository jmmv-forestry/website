<ul><li>Changed the <tt>--config</tt> and <tt>--variable</tt> options to be program-wide instead of command-specific. The configuration file should be able to hold properties that tune the behavior of Kyua, not just the execution of tests, so this makes sense.</li>
<li>Added the <tt>config</tt> subcommand, which provides a way to inspect the configuration as read by Kyua.</li>
<li>Got rid of the <tt>test_suites_var</tt> function from configuration files and replaced it by simple assignments to variables in the <tt>test_suites</tt> global table.</li>
<li>Enabled detection of unused parameters by the compiler and fixed all warnings.</li>
<li>Changed developer mode to only control whether warnings are enforced or not (not to enable the warnings themselves) and made developer mode be disabled on formal releases.</li>
</ul><div>Barring release testing, Kyua 0.2 should be ready soon :-)</div>
