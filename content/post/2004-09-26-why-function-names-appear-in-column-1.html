<p>Have you ever wondered about why many people writes C/C++ function definitions separating the return type from the function name? And why even style guides suggest you to do so? I'm referring to something like:</p>  <pre>int<br />main(void)<br />{<br />   ....<br />}</pre><p></p>  <p>The reason behind this is to simplify searching for functions. If the function name appears in column 1, it is very easy to construct a regular expression that matches the code you are looking for.</p>  <p>For example: suppose that you have to locate the <tt>main</tt> function; a simple <tt>grep ^main *.c</tt> will give you a very accurate match (often unique).  And in case it gives more results than desired, a <tt>grep '^main[ t]*(' *.c</tt> will return the exact match.  (When using <tt>egrep</tt>, you'll need to quote the left bracket.)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
