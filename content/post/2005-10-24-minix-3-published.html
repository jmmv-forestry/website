As seen in the <a href="http://www.minix3.org/news/index.html">MINIX news site</a>, the 3rd major release of this operating system has been released today.  As seen in the <a href="http://www.minix3.org/">new web site</a>:<br /><blockquote>MINIX 3 is a new open-source operating system designed to be highly reliable and secure. It is based somewhat on previous versions of MINIX, but is fundamentally different in many key ways. MINIX 1 and 2 were intended as teaching tools; MINIX 3 adds the new goal of being usable as a serious system on resource-limited and embedded computers and for applications requiring high reliability.</blockquote>The fact that it is based on a microkernel and published under a <a href="http://www.minix3.org/license.html">BSD-like license</a> have raised my interest in this new version â€” yes, I like the microkernel design more than the monolitical one (and this is one thing I don't like from <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a>).<br /><br />I've already tested the downloadable live CD and looks promising.  It's extremely fast, but obviously less functional than a complete BSD or Linux system (at least for now). I still remember when I tried Minix 2.something on a 386SX 16Mhz laptop; it really made a difference compared to Linux (using a Slackware 3.4).<br /><br />I guess we can expect nice things from this new code-base.<br /><span style=";font-family:Arial;font-size:85%;"  ><i></i></span>
