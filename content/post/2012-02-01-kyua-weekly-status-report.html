This comes two days late... but anyway, I felt like posting it now instead of waiting until next Sunday/Monday.<br /><br />The activity past week focused mostly on implementing support for the <tt>require.memory</tt> test-case metadata property recently introduced into ATF. This was non-trivial due to the need to write some tricky Autoconf code to make this "slightly portable".&nbsp;Seriously: It's scary to see how hard it is to perform, in a portable manner, an operation as simple as "query the amount of physical memory"... but oh well, such are the native Unix APIs...<br /><br />I later spent the weekend on Lutok, preparing and publishing the project's first release and writing my first RPM library spec for it. This was a prerequisite for the upcoming 0.3 release of Kyua and thus deserved special attention!
