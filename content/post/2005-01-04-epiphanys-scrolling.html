<p>For a long time, I've been believing that <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a>, the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> web browser, was broken when installed through <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>.  And I was starting to hate it.</p>  <p>The problem I had was that trying to scroll the page using the keyboard resulted in a cursor moving around the document, instead of scrolling the whole page. Believe me, <i>extremely annoying</i> behavior, since it jumped across columns unexpectedly.</p>  <p>My diagnostic was that I had hit some kind of compatibility problem between Epiphany and the version of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> I had installed through the <tt>mozilla-gtk2</tt> package. This belief was increased this morning when I noticed that the configuration script was not finding some header files properly. I reviewed it and fixed some problems, but the problem did not disappear.</p>  <p>So this evening, while surfing the net, I thought... let's search for a solution; typed "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&amp;q=epiphany+scrolling&btnG=Search">epiphany scrolling</a>" in <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and... ta-da!  There it was, the first match contained what I was looking for, a <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany_2fFrequentlyAskedQuestions">FAQ about Epiphany</a>.  Scrolled down to the eighth question from the sixth section, "<a href="http://live.gnome.org/Epiphany_2fFrequentlyAskedQuestions#head-1c172d6b6c35088d14f341cfb12dfe21134b2662">Scrolling with the keyboard doesn't work, and instead there's a cursor moving around!</a>", and found the solution.</p>  <p>Copying verbatim: 'You have activated "caret browsing" mode. Disable it with the F7 key.' OMG, OMG! What a stupid "problem" (if I can call it as such)! Pressed F7 and it went away. No comments. Just be aware it doesn't happen to you ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
