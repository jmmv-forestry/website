<p>First of all, happy new year!</p>  <p>As I <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmmv/20457.html">said</a> some days ago, a friend of mine and me have been working for a while (a month and a half, more or less) in a computer game as an university task. The deadline for the project was December 19th (so the subject related to it is over), but we decided to continue it as a free software project.</p>  <p>So, finally, I can announce that the game, named <a href="http://vigipac.sourceforge.net/">VigiPac</a>, is now public.  Summarizing, it aims to be a three-dimensional Pacman clone with networking support, licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> and written in ANSI C++.</p>  <p>There is still no formal release but the sources are available in a <a href="http://www.venge.net/monotone/">Monotone</a> (yay!) repository.  You can check out the current status of the project in its <a href="http://vigipac.sourceforge.net/features.html">features</a> page, and maybe have some fun trying it ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
