<p>Today I had to copy a bunch of files and symlinks to a remote machine.  My first attempt was to use <tt>scr</tt> directly:</p>  <pre>$ scp -r directory host:/some/directory</pre>  <p>But that went wrong: the symlinks were not preserved, which resulted in several files being transferred multiple times.</p>  <p>A simple solution could have been to create a tarball of the whole directory, copy it to the remote host and unpack it there. However, I thought... using <tt>tar</tt> on both ends through a pipe over SSH should work... so I tried... and it worked!  So how is this done?</p>  <pre>$ cd directory ; tar cvf - . | ssh sun tar xf - -C /some/directory</pre>  <p>Yes, it's that easy! Hmm I ask myself why I didn't try this before... BTW, remember that the target directory should exist; if it doesn't, adjust the command line a bit ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
