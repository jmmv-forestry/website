A couple of things have happened:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20110614-atf-0-14-released">Released ATF 0.14</a>. This release was followed by an import into NetBSD and fixing of subsequent fallout.</li><li>Some performance improvements to atf-sh. After killing a bunch of complex shell constructions and removing lots of obsolete functions, the performance results are significant. There is still room for improvement of course, and I still need to quantify how these optimizations behave in single-core machines.</li></ul>I certainly expected more progress this past week... but in case you don't know: I am moving countries very soon now, and as the move date approaches, there is more and more stuff to be done at home so less and less time for hacking.
