It is a new year again.<br /><br />Let's see if I can, at least, accomplish one goal: I should try to not delay stuff as much as I have been doing until now. This specially refers to replying to some e-mails and working on some stuff I once started but have not had the time to finish (bad excuses, I know). The clearest example that comes to my mind is Boost.Process, for which I have got many status-requests already... but there are also some tiny pet projects such as genfb support for NetBSD/mac68k and witheouts for tmpfs. Of course, there also is the conversion of more NetBSD tests to ATF.<br /><br />But, and this is a big but, the first semester of the year will probably keep me extremely busy with my Ph.D. courses... and, to make things worse, when I get home in the evening I'm so tired that I don't want to do more work. Will have to try to organize tasks a bit better so that there is time for everything.<br /><br />Anyway, happy new year to everyone!  And thanks to your continuous visits and support, this is the 400th post :-)
