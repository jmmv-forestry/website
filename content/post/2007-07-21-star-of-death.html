A cool photo I found today:<br /><br /><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1160/859756472_91daf86593.jpg?v=0"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 400px;" src="/images/2007-07-21-859756472_91daf86593.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I think I can say: don't be scared! That seems to be a power adapter so, supposedly, all those plugs are switched off when one of them is connected.  If they weren't... this would not pass any quality assurance control...   So, it is a pretty nice product :-)<br /><br />See the <a href="http://www.barisione.org/blog.html/p=94">original post</a> for more details.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit (23rd July)</span>: Corrected the (invented) title.
