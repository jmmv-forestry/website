Now that I know how to post images here, I think I'll be posting screenshots once in a while ;-)  Here comes my current desktop (the iBook attached to the 20" flat panel):<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1094/294/1600/screenshot.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="/images/2006-01-21-screenshot.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
