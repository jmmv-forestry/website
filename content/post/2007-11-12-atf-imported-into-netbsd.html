Finally!  After more than five months of development (with different intensities of work), I am very pleased to announce that <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/">ATF</a>, my Google Summer of Code 2007 project, has been integrated into the NetBSD source tree.<br /><br />For more details see the <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-userlevel/2007/11/12/0000.html">official announcement in the tech-userlevel@ mailing list</a>.
