<ul><li>My plan for this week was to release utils::lua as a separate module. Unfortunately, this has not been possible because I've been fighting with legal to clear the name for the project. I don't have an approved name yet, so this will have to wait a bit more :-(</li><li>On another order of things, I have started writing a design document for the database that will collect test case results and other information. Will share it as soon as it is readable and more or less complete.</li></ul>
