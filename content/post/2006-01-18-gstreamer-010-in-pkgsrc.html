I've <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2006/01/18/0009.html">uploaded GStreamer 0.10</a>, the <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2006/01/18/0010.html">base plugins set</a> and the <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2006/01/18/0011.html">good plugins set </a> to pkgsrc.  This new major version is parallel installable with the prior 0.8 series; this is why all the <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2006/01/18/0004.html">old packages have been renamed</a> to make things clearer.<br /><br />Fortunately, this version was easier to package because it does not need a "plugin registry" as the previous one did (i.e., no need for install-time scripts).  Even though, the split of the plugins in different distfiles (base, good, bad, et. al.) make it a bit more complex.<br /><br />Let's now wait until someone packages Beep Media Player's development version and we'll be able to enjoy its features (assuming it works fine, of course...).<br /><br />I have to confess that I'm losing interest in maintaining the GNOME-related packages in pkgsrc.  They take me <i>too much</i> time, time that I'd rather spend on other NetBSD-related tasks.  This is why this update has been delayed so much...
