Not a very active week: I've been on-call four days and they have been quite intense. Plus I have had to go through a "hurricane" in NYC. That said, I had some time to do a bit of work on Kyua and the results have been nice :-)
<br /><ul><li>Made calls to <span style="font-weight: bold;">getopt_long(3)</span> work with GNU Getopt by using the correct value of optind to reset option processing.</li><li>Improved the configure script to error out in a clearer way when missing dependencies (pkg.m4 and Lua) are not found.</li><li>Did some portability fixes.</li><li>And <a href="{{< relref "2011-08-24-kyua-02-released.html" >}}">released Kyua 0.2</a>! (along with a pkgsrc package)
<br /></li></ul>At this point, I have to start thinking how to implement test suite reporting within Kyua (i.e. how to replace <span style="font-weight: bold;">atf-report</span>). This probably means learning SQLite and refreshing my incredibly rusty SQL skills.
<br />
<br />Also, it's time to (probably) split the <span style="font-weight: bold;">utils::lua</span> library in a separate package because there is several people interested in this.
<br />
