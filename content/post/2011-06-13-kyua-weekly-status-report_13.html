<div><ul><li>Added support for recursion from the top-level Kyuafile. This Kyuafile should not reference any directories explicitly because the directories at the top level are supposed to be created by the installation of packages. Closed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=9&amp;can=1">issue 9</a>.</li><li>Improved error messages when the test programs are bogus. Closed <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=13&amp;can=1">issue 13</a>.</li><li>Backported format-printf attribute improvements from NetBSD head to ATF.</li><li>Miscellaneous build and run fixes for both Kyua and ATF in NetBSD and OS X.</li><li>Cut a release candidate for atf-0.14 and started testing on NetBSD.</li></ul><div>The kyua-cli codebase is now feature complete. Blocking the 0.1 release are the need to polish the release documents and the requirement of releasing atf-0.14 beforehand. Should happen soon :-)</div></div>
