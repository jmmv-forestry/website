<br /><ul><li>Submitted a placeholder implementation of the new persistence layer (<tt>store</tt> top-level directory). This only supports opening a database and ensuring its metadata is valid. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=253">See r253</a>.</li><li>Added a <tt>db-exec</tt> CLI command to execute arbitrary SQL commands onto the database. This is handy during development and testing, but may also help users to extract information out of the database in those cases where the CLI does not cover their needs just yet. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=255">See r255</a>.</li><li>Miscellaneous fixes and improvements to <tt>utils::env</tt> and <tt>utils::sqlite</tt>.</li><li>Preliminary code to support putting objects (like actions and contexts) into the database. I've been thinking about this for a while and finally came up with a design that completely decouples the persistence needs from the higher-level classes in the <tt>engine</tt> layer. I haven't submitted the code yet though, as it lacks tests. (Still thinking how to write the loading of objects though.)</li></ul>
