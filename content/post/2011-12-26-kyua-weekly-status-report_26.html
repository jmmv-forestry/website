The post title should mention ATF instead of Kyua... but I'm keeping the usual one for consistency:<br /><br /><ul><li>Integrated timestamps into the XML and HTML reports generated by <tt>atf-report</tt>. These should soon show up in the continuous tests of NetBSD.</li><li>Work on integrating the use of POSIX timers into <tt>atf-run</tt> after Christos Zoulas performed these changes in the NetBSD tree. The result is quite awful because I need to keep compatibility with systems that do not provide the "new" interface...</li></ul>
