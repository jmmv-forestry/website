I've just decided to learn how to publish images in <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>.  And in fact, it's damn easy, but for some reason I thought it was not &mdash; that is, I believed I had to register myself in some other service and was lazy to do it...<br /><br />Here come some pictures of my rig:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1094/294/1600/100_5830.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="/images/2006-01-17-100_5830.jpg" border="0" alt="The desktop" /></a><br />The picture above shows my desktop.  You can see the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook G4</a> working in clamshell mode (well, sort of).  It's connected to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> keyboard, to the mini mouse (I ought to replace it), to the <a href="http://www.benq.com/Products/product.cfm?product=608">BenQ FP202W</a> flat pannel and to the stereo system.  If you can notice the free USB wire next to the laptop... that's my manual switch for the keyboard and mouse! ;-)  On the right side below the table is my PC, the Athlon XP 2600+ machine.  Oh, and there is the Palm m515, this month's <a href="http://www.ddj.com/">DDJ</a> issue and a 802.11 book I got recently.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1094/294/1600/100_5831.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="/images/2006-01-17-100_5831.jpg" border="0" alt="The test machine" /></a><br />This other picture shows the machine I used during tmpfs development to do all the necessary tests.  It's a Pentium 2 233Mhz with 128Mb of RAM and is connected to the PC with a serial line (plus to the Ethernet, of course).  (I've been playing with <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">qemu</a> recently and I might get rid of it.)  Below the speaker (on the floor) is my old <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/">Viewsonic</a> monitor that I'm trying to sell.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1094/294/1600/100_5832.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="/images/2006-01-17-100_5832.jpg" border="0" alt="The old Macintosh" /></a><br />At last, this other picture shows the <a href="http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/mac_performa/stats/mac_performa_630.html">Apple Macintosh Performa 630</a> I found a year and a half ago (no, the monitor is not currently connected).  It's waiting for a reinstall of <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Ports/mac68k/">NetBSD/mac68k</a>. Ah, and there is also a VHS video on the left side of the table which is connected to the PC.<br /><br />Next time I shall publish pictures of the <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/12/soc-got-t-shirt.html">SoC</a> and <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/12/monotone-got-t-shirt.html">Monotone</a> T-shirts ;-)
