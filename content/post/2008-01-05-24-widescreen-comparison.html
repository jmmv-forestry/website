As promised in the previous post <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2007/12/choosing-24-widescreen-monitor.html">Choosing a 24" widescreen monitor</a>, here comes the brief analysis I did before deciding which monitor to buy.  Refer to the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/julipedia/20080105-24-widescreens.xhtml">comparison table</a> (or the <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/julipedia/20080105-24-widescreens.pdf">PDF version</a> if the XHTML one does not work for you) for more details.  I'm linking this externally because putting it here, in this width-limited page, would be unsuitable.<br /><br />The data in that table has been taken from the official vendor pages when possible, even though they failed to list some of the details.  I tried to look for the missing ones around the network and came up with, I think, fairly trustable data.  But of course some of them may be wrong.<br /><br />By the way, be specially careful when comparing the <i>Contrast ratio</i> and <i>Response time</i> fields.  Each vendor likes to advertise these in different ways, so you cannot really compare them without knowing what each value really means (and I don't, because they generally don't specify it).<br /><br />Anyway, even the table is not complete (some fields are marked with N/A because I could not easily came up with an answer), I hope it will be useful to some of you.
