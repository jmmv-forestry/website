<p>Two years ago or so, I registered a weblog at <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, which only lasted a week (don't bother looking for it; it was deleted). At that time, I didn't like that site much, specially because it lacked a very important feature: integrated support for comments. Yes, you could use external utilities/sites to host comments, but that was complex.</p><p>However, a few minutes ago, I discovered that they now have comments support; yay! I spent some time surfing their site and found it very intuitive. Also, I registered a new weblog (whose name I won't unveil yet, but a friend of mine will know which it is ;-) just to see which features they support now.</p><p>And all I can say is that it seems better than <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a>...  Here are some reasons:<br /></p><ul><li>Blogger applies the weblog style to all pages: posts and comments. Here at Livejournal, only the front page gets the look you design, but all comment ones have a standard, non-customizable and ugly look (I don't know about paid accounts).</li><li>As regards the style, Blogger lets you customize it completely, editing the HTML code directly. Livejournal does not let you do this unless you have a paid account.</li><li>Blogger addresses are shorter and easier to remember: http://&lt;blogname&gt;.blogspot.com/ vs. http://www.livejournal.com/users/&lt;user&gt;.</li><li>The blogger interface seems to be more intuitive than Livejournal's one.</li><li>Blogger lets you post images on your blog (without external links).</li><li>Blogger lets you post by e-mail.</li><li>Neither Livejournal nor Blogger have support to track blog statistics. However, Blogger lets you add statistics trackers from other sites, which is a plus.</li><li>My beloved <a href="http://www.dropline.net/drivel/">Drivel</a> supports both systems, so easier migration from this POV.</li></ul><p>So... I'm seriously considering migrating this blog there, because the reasons mentioned above. However, there are two things against this idea: people will have to update their address (though I don't think there are many readers out there ;) and, worst of all, I don't know if it's possible to easily migrate all the existing posts to the new site (and this is a must).</p><p>Anyone has comments on this? Any counter-arguments or suggestions? :-)</p><p><b>Edit 18:08</b>: The statistics item was added.</p>
