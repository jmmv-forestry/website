Just in time for the mid-term evaluation (well, with one day of delay), I've made the atf's source code public.  This is possible thanks to the <a href="http://mtn-host.prjek.net/">public and free monotone server</a> run by Timothy Brownawell.  It's nice to stay away from CVS ;-)<br /><br />See the <i>How to get it</i> section at the <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/atf/">atf's page</a> for more details on how to download the code from that server and how to trust it (it may take an hour or two for the section to appear).  You can also go straight to the <a href="http://mtn-host.prjek.net/viewmtn/atf/">source code browser</a>.  If, by any chance, you decide to download the code, be sure to read the <tt>README</tt> files as they contain very important information.<br /><br />And... don't start nitpicking yet!  I haven't had a chance to clean up the code yet, and some parts of it really suck.  Cleaning it up is the next thing I'll be doing, and I already started with the shell library :-)
