I've just finished writing a monograph for the <a href="http://studies.ac.upc.edu/ALE/ArqPC/">APC university course</a>, a subject in which we study the PC architecture.  <a href="http://apc.gotdns.org/moodledata/3/moddata/assignment/34/21/RAID_-_Trabajo.pdf">My monograph</a> talks about RAID and is 30 pages long.  It starts describing what RAID is, which levels it has and ends up analyzing some current hardware and software solutions to set up a RAID system.  Please note that it is in the Spanish language.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, this makes the 200 post! :-)
