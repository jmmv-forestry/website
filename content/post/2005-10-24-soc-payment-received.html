Being part of <a href="http://soc.blubb.com/">Planet SoC</a>, I think it is a good idea to post this: I've just received <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'s cheque for my Summer of Code 2005 tmpfs project!  I'm happy :-)<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to some tax issues, Google has withhold a 30% of the original payment. I hope to be able to ask for a refund the next year...
