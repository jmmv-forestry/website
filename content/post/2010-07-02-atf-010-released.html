Ladies and gentlemen: I have just released ATF 0.10!  This release with such a magic number includes lots of new exciting features and provides a much simplified source tree.<br /><br />Dive into the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf/releases/0.10/">0.10 release page</a> for details!<br /><br />I'm now working in getting this release into the NetBSD tree to remove some of the custom patches that have been superseded by the official release. Will be there soon.<br /><br />And all this while I am a <a href="http://www.meetbsd.org/">meetBSD</a> in Krak√≥w :-)
