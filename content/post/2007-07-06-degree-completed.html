After five years of intensive work, I've finally completed my degree in <a href="http://www.fib.upc.edu/en/infoAca.html">Informatics Engineering</a> (I think Computer Science is a valid synonym for that) at the <a href="http://www.fib.upc.edu/fib/">FIB Faculty</a>.  This has concluded today after I defended my PFC, the project that concludes the degree.  So you can now call me <i>engineer</i> :-)  Yay!<br /><br />In other words: I'm free until October, when I'll start a Masters in Computer Architecture, Networks and Systems (CANS).  Time to work intensively on SoC!
