If memory serves well, today makes the sixth month since I have got my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> and, during this period, have been using it as my sole computer.  I feel it is a good time for another <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2007/01/macbook-pro-review.html">mini-review</a>.<br /><br />Well... to get started: this machine is great; I probably haven't been happier with any other computer before.  I have been able to work on real stuff &mdash; instead of maintaining the machine &mdash; during these months without a hitch.  Strictly speaking I've got a couple of problems... but that was "my fault" for installing experimental kernel drivers.<br /><br />As regards the machine's speed, which I think is the main reason why I wanted to write this post: it is pretty impressive considering it is a laptop.  With a good amount of RAM, programs behave correctly and games can be played at high quality settings with a decent FPS rate.  But, and everything has a "but": I really, really, <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> hate its hard disk (a 160 GB, 5400 RPM drive).  I cannot stress that more.  It's slow.  Painfully slow under medium load.  Seek times are horrible.  That alone makes me feel I'm using a 10 year-old machine.  I'm waiting for the shiny-new big 7200 RPM drives to become a bit easier to purchase and will make the switch, even if that means my battery life will be a bit shorter.<br /><br />About Mac OS X... what can I say that you already don't know.  It is very comfortable for daily use &mdash; although that's very subjective, of course; it's quite "funny" to read some reviews that blame OS X for not behaving exactly like Windows &mdash; and, being based on Unix, allows me to do serious development with a sane command-line environment and related tools.  <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/">Parallels Desktop for Mac</a> is my preferred tool so far as I can <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2007/04/cross-platform-development-with.html">seamlessly work with Windows-only programs</a> and do Linux/NetBSD development, but other free applications are equally great; some worth of mention: <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium X</a>, <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> or <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a>.<br /><br />At last, sometimes I miss having a desktop computer at home because watching TV series/movies on the laptop is rather annoying &mdash; I have to keep adjusting the screen's position so it's properly visible when laying on bed.  I can imagine that an iMac with the included remote control and Front Row could be awesome for this specific use.<br /><br />All in all, don't hesitate to buy this machine if you are considering it as a laptop or desktop replacement.  But be sure to pick the new 7200 RPM drive if you will be doing any slightly-intensive disk operation.
