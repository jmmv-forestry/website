Finally some progress!<br /><br /><ul><li>Backported the <tt>require.memory</tt> changes in NetBSD to the ATF upstream code, and extended them to support OS X as well.</li><li>Backported local pkgsrc patches to ATF into the upstream code.</li><li>Started to prepare ATF 0.15 by doing test runs of NetBSD/i386 and NetBSD/amd64 and by building the code in various Linux distributions. Several build bugs fixed along the way.</li><li>Spent a long while trying to figure out how the Fedora package maintainer procedure has changed since 3 years ago to create packages for ATF, Lutok and Kyua. Not very successful yet unfortunately.</li></ul><div>Nothing on the Kyua front, but getting a new release of ATF out of the door has higher priority now!</div>
