Reposting from the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20070820-second-preview-of-netbsd-with-atf">original ATF news entry</a>:<br /><blockquote></blockquote><p></p><p></p><blockquote><p>I have just updated the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20070808-first-preview-of-netbsd-with-atf">first   preview of NetBSD-current</a> release builds with ATF merged in to   match the ATF 0.1 release published today.  As already stated in the   old news item:  These will ease testing to the casual user who is   interested in this project because he will not need to mess with   patches to the NetBSD source tree nor rebuild a full release, which is   a delicate and slow process.  For the best experience, these releases   are meant to be installed from scratch even though you can also do an   upgrade of a current installation.  They will give you a preview of   how a NetBSD installation will look like once ATF is imported into it;   we are not sure when that will happen, though.</p><p>By the way, ATF 0.1 is also in pkgsrc as <tt>devel/atf</tt>.   This may be an easier way for you to try it, even though you will not   get the NetBSD-specific tests.</p><p>For more details see my <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/current-users/2007/08/20/0021.html">post   to the NetBSD's current-users</a> mailing list.</p></blockquote><p></p>Enjoy!<p></p>
