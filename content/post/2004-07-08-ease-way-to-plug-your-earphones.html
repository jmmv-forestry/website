<p>I was tired of having to manually connect the earphones every night to my computer and disconnect the speakers. So I decided to put a solution: construct a small "switch". All you need are some cheap pieces and some hours to work on it (how many depends on your experience).</p>  <p>What I've done is the following: put a switch which alternates between two female jacks (one to connect the speakers and one to connect the headphones). Both circuits are connected to the computer output through the switch. A very, very simple circuit. Everything is inside a small metal box, which I've attached in the bottom surface of the table. (You can also assemble everything inside your computer, if you want to avoid the extra box.)</p>  <p>That's all!  Now switching to the headphones is a matter of pressing a button ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
