Many things have happened this week, but they can all be summarized in one single sentence: <tt><b>kyua test</b></tt><b> now records the results of the execution of a test suite into the SQLite database</b>.<br /><br />"Why is this important?", you ask. Well, that's a good question. Recording test results opens the gate to many long-awaited features that should be coming soon, such as the ability to inspect the history of a particular test, to query all available data of a test result and/or to generate a dashboard of test results. It's interesting to realize that <i>most of these features are just one SQL query away</i>. If you install Kyua, you can already run a few tests and then use <tt>kyua db-exec</tt> to issue arbitrary SQL queries against the database; the schema (see <tt>store/schema.sql</tt>) might look a bit convoluted, but a bunch of <tt>NATURAL JOIN</tt>s will yield the desired output.<br /><br />The feature requests that have the highest priority at this point are the ability to generate a report of the last tests run both as a text file and as an HTML dashboard, because having these features means we can finally kill the <tt>atf-run</tt> and <tt>atf-report</tt> pair. At this point I'm, once again, "stuck" while figuring out how to best organize the code to make all these things possible while still keeping a nice separation across the existing layers (<tt>cli</tt>, <tt>engine</tt> and <tt>store</tt>)... all without introducing much unnecessary complexity. But exciting times lie ahead!
