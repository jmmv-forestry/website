<p>First of all, let me apologize for not posting in several days. Unfortunately, this situation will continue as my time is quite limited because of university stuff...</p>  <p>Anyway, to the point of this post. A few days ago I found an interesting article that talks about free software and good user interfaces; you can read it <a href="http://www106.pair.com/rhp/free-software-ui.html">here</a>. It starts giving a summary of what a good UI should be, why free software can design good interfaces (comparing UI design to code design) and whether commercial companies help or hurt this process.</p>  <p>Later on, it describes the "too many preferences" problem. It explains why a bloat of costumization options leads to an unusable program, and what can be done to improve this situation. I wholeheartedly agree with the author's comments after having used <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> 2.x for a while.  Specially, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a> and <a href="http://www.imendio.com/projects/gossip/">Imendio Gossip</a> are two excellent applications in the usability field.  They Just Work (TM) and don't lack any important functionality.</p>  <p>An example of why too many customization makes programs difficult to use can be found in this <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/ut1_report/report_main.html">analysis</a>.  It is a bit old (applies to GNOME 1.4), but is still worth reading.</p>  <p>So, if you are a developer, and your programs have a graphical interface, consider making their UI usable (and accessible). Read the <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/">GNOME Human Interface Guidelines</a> for more information, and ask the UI experts (through the existent mailing lists) when in doubt.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
