<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf/news.html#20120116-atf-0-15-released">Released ATF 0.15</a> and imported it into NetBSD.</li><li>Added support for integer/float printf-like modifiers to the <tt>utils::format</tt> module. These will be required to beautify size and time quantities in the reports and error messages.</li><ul><li>I spent way more time than I wanted on this. At first, I attempted to use <tt>std::snprintf</tt> to parse and process the format modifiers for integers and floats so that I could avoid implementing a custom parser for them. While this sounds like a cool idea (yay, code reuse!), it resulted in a ugly, nasty and horrible mess. In the end, I just ended up implementing custom parsing of the formatters, which was way easier and "good enough" for Kyua's needs.</li></ul><li>Started work on backporting ATF's new <tt>require.memory</tt> property into Kyua. This needs having a way to parse and format byte quantities in user-friendly forms (e.g. 1k, 2m, etc.)... hence the previous work on <tt>utils::format</tt>!</li><li>Set up a <a href="https://plus.google.com/b/109170076014992185386/">Google+ Page for Kyua</a>. I have no idea what to use it for yet. Maybe the status reports should go in there. Ideas?</li></ul>
