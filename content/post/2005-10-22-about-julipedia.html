The Julipedia is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/2409542">Julio M. Merino Vidal</a>'s personal blog; this was born on June 22nd, 2004, and was previously known as <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmmv/">jmmv's weblog</a>.  On October 22nd, 2005, jmmv's weblog was officially migrated from <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> to <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> due to <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/10/blogger.html">multiple reasons</a> (beeing the ability to control visits the most important one).<br /><br />The transition was an ideal moment to rename the blog to give it an identity of its own, and hence The Julipedia was born. This name was invented by <a href="http://blogs.nopcode.org/brainstorm/">Brainstorm</a>, a friend of mine, who uses to call me by this name.  It is composed of two parts, as you can see: <i>Juli</i>, which is the Catalan spelling of my first name, and <i>pedia</i>, which comes after <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.  I believe this is because I often answer his Unix related questions quickly :-)<br /><br />I hope you like the new look and structure of the blog; it should be easier to navigate than before. And, of course, be welcome to the blog if you are new to it!<br /><br />(The aim of this post is to be linked from the Basics column on the sidebar.  Its contents can change without further notice.)
