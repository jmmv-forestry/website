While waiting for a NetBSD release build to finish, I've prepared the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/">web site for ATF</a>.  It currently lacks information in a lot of areas, but the most important ones for now &mdash; the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/rss-news.xml">RSS feed for news</a> and the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/repository.html">Repository page</a> &mdash; are quite complete.<br /><br />Hope you like it! Comments welcome, of course :-)
