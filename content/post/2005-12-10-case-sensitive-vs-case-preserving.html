A file system is case-sensitive when it differentiaties uppercase letters from lowercase ones.  This means that <tt>foo.c</tt> is not the same thing as <tt>Foo.c</tt> and therefore you are allowed to have these two files living in the same directory. While I've lived with case-sensitive file systems for a long time (since I discovered Unix), I haven't yet found any advantages to them except for an easier and faster implementation.  In these file systems, detecting a file match is a matter of a raw comparison of the characters you are given agains the ones stored on disc.  Examples of case-sensitive file systems include UFS, Ext3, Reiser, etc., while examples of the other set include VFAT, NTFS and HFS+.<br /><br />On the other hand, case-insensitive file systems can be case-preserving or not.  A file system is case preserving if it keeps the case of the file names as they are entered.  For example, if you name a file <tt>Foo.c</tt>, it will appear as such in all listings, not <tt>foo.c</tt> nor <tt>FOO.C</tt>.  Such file systems include VFAT, NTFS and HFS+.  However, if the file system is not case-preserving, it will convert all file names to either uppercase or lowercase.  An example is the old FAT, which shows all 8.3 file names in uppercase letters.<br /><br />I'm sorry for not having posted in more than 20 days, but this university project (<a href="http://www.fib.upc.es/ca/Estudis/Assignatures/PROP.html">PROP</a>, if you must know) is really exhausting me.  Not to mention that I've taken the FCE exam today, too...
