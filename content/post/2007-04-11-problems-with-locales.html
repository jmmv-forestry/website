Reviewing photos from my trip to Punta Cana, I found this one taken at Punta Cana's airport:<br /><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RhyOfHSUW5I/AAAAAAAAAAs/7ybeykkiLKA/s1600-h/CIMG0369.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/images/2007-04-11-CIMG0369.jpg" /></a><br />Looks like they had some problems with locales!  The text should have read <i>Espa√±a</i> (or Spain).<br /><br />On a related note, it was also curious to see all other monitors mention the flight's destination <i>city</i> whereas ours showed the whole <i>country</i>.  According to the other screens, it should have really said Madrid.
