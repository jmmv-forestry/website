<p>My little project these last two days has been to convert the <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a> packages to use the options framework and deprecate the old-style variables to tune its behavior. This is the "new" (has been around for a while already) way to go in <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, as it's cleaner, more homogeneous and more flexible.</p>  <p>During the conversion, I've added a lot more optional features in the package so that users can build a smaller package if wanted. Have fun ;)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
