I am open to suggestions from my readers — that is, you — for future posts. Keep in mind that these are mere suggestions: I reserve the right to talk about those that I find interesting and omit those that don't. Note that this post's comments might be deleted in the future to leave room for newer ones.<br /><br />Here is a non-exclusive list of topics I am inclined to cover:<br /><ul>   <li>General programming questions — specially if they are focused on C++.</li>   <li>General Unix questions — specially if they target BSD systems.</li><li>General portability questions.<br /> </li>    <li><a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> internals and questions about the packages I maintain (mostly <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>).<br /></li>   <li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> internals (to some extent; I will be glad to explain what I have learned so far but I do not know much yet).</li>   <li>Questions about my own software projects.</li> </ul>Please note that this is not meant to be a technical support forum. If you need help using any of the projects listed above, please refer to their documentation and/or public mailing lists.<br /><br />Yes, I took the idea of a suggestion box from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">The Old New Thing</a> ;-)<br /><br />(The aim of this post is to be linked from the Basics column on the sidebar.  Its contents can change without further notice.)
