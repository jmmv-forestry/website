<p>I'm going on vacation tomorrow and will be back by the end of the month. I'll bring my laptop with me, but I won't have regular Internet access (unless there is an open AP close to the place, that is). This will make my SoC's project development a bit more difficult, as I won't have my workstation (fast build machine) nor a test machine (very useful for kernel development).</p>  <p>I hope I've collected enough information to start working on the project and will continue to devour it in the next days; until now, I've read a bit of the I/O chapter from the 4.4BSD book and it's very, very interesting. I have also configured NetBSD appropriately in the laptop to be able to work in the project easily.</p>  <p>Despite this, I hope to be able to connect to the Internet, at the very least, once per week. When I do this, I'll try to reply to any urgent mail, synchronize my local development tree with the one on <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/">NetBSD-SoC</a> (remember <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmmv/36952.html">Monotone's CVS gateway</a>? ;-) )and post an status report to this blog.</p>  <p>See you soon!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
