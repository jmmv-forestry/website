<p>Have you ever wondered why building C++ code is so awfully slow and, apparently, compilation times haven't gotten any better over the course of many years?</p> <p>Wonder no more.  This article on <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/c-compilation-speed/228701711">C++ Compilation Speed</a> published on August 17, 2010 on Dr. Dobb's delves into the problem.  Mind you, a major cause of such slowdowns are header files and the fact that they are a <a href="/2013/12/header-files-poor-mans-replacement-for.html">horrible replacement for a modules system</a>.  I felt that such article fit these series perfectly well, so here it goes.</p> <p>That's all from me today.  Yes, now go and read the referenced article for maximum benefit!</p>
