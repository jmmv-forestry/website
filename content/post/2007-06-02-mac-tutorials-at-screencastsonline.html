I've recently subscribed to (the free version of) <a href="http://screencastsonline.com/">ScreenCasts Online</a> based on some comments I read somewhere.  This is a video podcast that explains tips and tricks for the Mac, and presents third party software — either commercial or free — in great detail, which is ideal if you are planning to purchase some specific commercial program.<br /><br />The typical show starts by presenting a problem to be resolved or by directly talking about the specific program to be presented.  It is then followed by a detailed inspection of the user interface and some sections that exemplify common tasks.  At the very end, it gives pointers to either fetch or buy the program.  I have to confess that I find some of these shows to be excessively detailed, to the point of becoming boring at some point.  But they are still a good way to see all the possibilities a given program can offer.<br /><br />"Thanks" to them, I've fallen in love with <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> and <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/">OmniPlan</a> ;-)  Pity they are so expensive because I won't be paying that amount of money for my extremely modest needs.
