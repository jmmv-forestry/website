A couple of weeks ago, I received a notification from GNOME's Bugzilla telling me that <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134119">one of my bug reports was closed</a>, being marked as <i>incomplete</i>.  That really bothered me a lot because it was closed without applying <i>any</i> fix to the code &mdash; after all, NetBSD is dead, right?<br /><br />What is worse: the maintainers acknowledged that the bug report was correct, so there is a real bug in glib.  So why the hell was it closed without intervention?  Fixing it is a matter of 5 minutes or less for an experienced glib developer.<br /><br />OK, fine, you'd try to blame me: I failed to provide a patch in a timely fashion but that's not a good reason to close a bug report without a fix.  At the very least, they'd have tried to contact me or the other developer who spoke up again &mdash; if they had, I'd have done the patch because I simply forgot about the report.<br /><br />So... do not close a bug if it is still there and you are aware of it!
