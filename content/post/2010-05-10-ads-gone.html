Almost a year ago, I decided to <a href="{{< relref "2009-06-10-trying-adsense.html" >}}">give a try to AdSense</a>. And, so far, the "earnings" have been ~30 EUR which I cannot even cash. Given this and how ugly and disturbing the ads look on the front page, I have disabled them. (I think the ads have gotten much worse over time... but as I do not pay attention to the front page, I didn't see them.) Thanks to Roman Valls for pointing this out!
