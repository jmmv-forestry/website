Belated update:<div><ul><li>Created a pkgsrc package for kyua-cli. Still in pkgsrc-wip though because pkgsrc is in a feature freeze.</li><li>Wrote a little tutorial on <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/wiki/HowtoRunNetBSDTests">how to run NetBSD tests using Kyua</a>.</li><li>Started work on 0.2 by doing a minor UI fix in the about command.</li></ul><div>I've now started to look at how to split the engine into different "runners" to add support for test programs written without ATF. Not that I plan to use this feature... but having it in place will ensure that the internal interfaces are clean and may help in adoption of Kyua.</div></div>
