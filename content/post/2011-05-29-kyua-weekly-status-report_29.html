Some cool stuff this week, albeit not large-scale:<br /><br /><ul><li>Implemented the <tt>--variable</tt> flag in the <tt>test</tt> command.  This flag, which can be specified multiple times, allows a user to override any configuration variable (be it a built-in or a test-suite variable) from the command line.  This is actually the same as <tt>atf-run</tt>'s <tt>-v</tt> flag, but with a clear separation between built-in configuration settings and test-suite specific settings.</li><li>Added support for several environment variables to allow users (and tests) to override built-in paths.  I can't imagine right now any legitimate use for these variables, but hardcoded values are bad in general, <tt>atf-run</tt> provided these same variables, and these variables are very handy for testing purposes.</li><li>Added support for the new <tt>require.files</tt> test-case metadata property to both ATF and Kyua.  This new property allows tests to specify a set of files that they require in order to run, and is useful for those tests that can't run before <tt>make install</tt> is executed.<br /></ul>The functionality planned for the 0.1 release is now pretty much complete.  There is still a few rough edges to clean, some documentation to write, and some little features to implement/fix.  See the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/list?can=2&q=Milestone%3DRelease0.1+&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&cells=tiles">open bugs for 0.1</a> to get an idea of the remaining tasks.
