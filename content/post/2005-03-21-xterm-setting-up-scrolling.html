<p>Back to the days when I used <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> (that was more than a year ago), I got used to the Shift+Up and Shift+Down keybindings in Konsole (I have to say it's a <i>great</i> terminal emulator).  These keys combinations scroll up and down, respectively, a <i>single line of text</i>.</p>  <p>When I later switched to <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>, I was quite disappointed to see that these were not supported by gnome-terminal. In fact, this may be false, but I didn't spend too much time looking for it because gnome-terminal is way too slow.</p>  <p>So I switched back to XTerm, the genuine terminal emulator which, at first, seemed to not support these key combinations either. As I was aware of XTerm being highly configurable, I spent some time reading the manual until I figured out how to set scrolling up.</p>  <p>What I found is that XTerm can map any key combination you want to one of its integrated functions, so all I had to do was to map Shift+Up to <tt>scroll-back(1)</tt> and Shift+Down to <tt>scroll-forw(1)</tt>.  In other words, I had to add the following to the <tt>~/.Xresources</tt> file:</p>  <pre>*VT100.Translations: #override Shift &lt;Key&gt;Up: scroll-back(1) n                    Shift &lt;Key&gt;Down: scroll-forw(1)</pre><p></p>  <p>While we are at scrolling, here is another little trick which will increase the amount of lines stored in the terminal backlog:</p>  <pre>XTerm*saveLines: 512</pre>  <p>Reload your X settings (<tt>xrdb -m ~/.Xresources</tt>) and you are done!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
