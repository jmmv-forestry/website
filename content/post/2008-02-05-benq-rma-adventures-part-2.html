My monitor is back from service!  It was picked up on <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2008/01/benq-rma-adventures-part-1.html">January 30th</a>, and it has been returned today just after 6 days (4 work days).  Note that the technical service's office was located in Portugal, just at the opposite side of the peninsula.<br /><br />And best of all, the monitor is fixed: firmware updated, so I can now disable the Overscan feature and get a perfect 1:1 pixel mapping on the HDMI input.  Kudos to the BenQ RMA service for this quick and effective service!
