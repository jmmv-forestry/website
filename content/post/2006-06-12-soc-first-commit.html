Due to all the university tasks <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/05/what-is-keeping-me-busy.html">I had to finish</a>, I could not start work on my SoC project eariler than this weekend.  Final exams are now around the corner (first one on the 21st, last one on the 30th), but I will have to balance study time and SoC work if I want to make progress in both directions... and I have to!<br /><br />Sincerely, I was lazy to start working on my project because I had to investigate how <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>'s build infrastructure works and how to integrate a new library into it.  However, as this had to be done, I sat down today and some hours, I passed that barrier.  It has not been easy, though: everything is fairly well documented, but it is not organized in a way that a novice can see the overall picture.  Now that the basic project files are up, I am really eager to continue working on the project.<br /><br />What I have done today has been to understand how to set up a standalone project using Boost.Build v2 (that is, outside the Boost's source code) and how to set up the basic documentation using <a href="http://www.boost.org/tools/quickbook/doc/html/index.html">QuickBook</a>.  The following logical step is to integrate all the <a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostProcess">notes I took a year ago</a> and complete them with other requirements and useful information.<br /><br />The Boost people kindly set up a <a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/">Trac system</a> and a <a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/browser/boost/soc/2006/">Subversion repository</a> for us to work on our SoC projects.  So... the above has made its way into my <a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/changeset/302">first commit</a> to the tree!<br /><br />And before I forget: this past weekend I started to investigate the MFC to learn how to manage processes under Windows, a requirement for this project.  More on this on future posts.
