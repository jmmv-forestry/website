Mmm... SoC.  Multiple things have been going on lately in my SoC project, yet I've kept you uninformed.   As I <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/05/soc-accepted-again.html">already told you</a>, my project aims to develop a C++ library for the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> project to manage child processes; it's named <a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/wiki/process">Boost.Process</a>.<br /><br />During June I discussed with Jeff Garland &mdash; my mentor &mdash; the <a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/wiki/process/DesignThoughts">general design</a> of the library.  The design is surely not final but it is a lot better than it was at its first sketches.  For example: it makes use of templates where appropriate to let the user replace any part of the library with his own code (more or less).  I must say he has been very patient with all my questions and has provided extremely valuable information.<br /><br />I also seized that month to investigate a bit the Win32 API because the library must work on Windows too.  I couldn't do much more during that time because I was busy with semester's final exams.  All passed by the way :-)<br /><br />And now to the interesting thing.  I've spent the past week (almost two) implementing a preliminary prototype.  It is still incomplete but has already raised <a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/wiki/process/Prototype">many issues</a>; you know, it is hard to get into the details (that affect the design) without coding a bit.  The prototype also includes multiple unit tests to ensure that everything works, as it shall be; Boost's <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/test/doc/components/utf/index.html">Unit Test Framework</a> is a really nice tool to implement them.<br /><br /><a href="https://boost-consulting.com:8443/trac/soc/browser/boost/soc/2006/process/trunk">Browse the source code</a> for more details.
