I have just merged my <tt>net.venge.monotone.help-rewrite</tt> branch into the mainline <a href="http://monotone.ca/">Monotone</a>'s source code.  I already explained its purpose <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2007/04/monotones-help-rewrite.html">in a past post</a>, so please refer to it to see what has changed.<br /><br />There is still some work to do on the "help rewrite" area, but I won't have the time to do it in the near future.  Hence I added some items to the ROADMAP file explaining what needs to be done, hoping that someone else can pick them up and do the work.  They are not difficult but they can introduce you to Monotone's development if you are interested! ;-)
