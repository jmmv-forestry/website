<p>Jeremy C. Reed has collected an excellent list of <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>'s strengths.  I encourage you to read his <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-pkg/2005/08/24/0013.html">post to tech-pkg@</a> in case you still had doubts about why to use pkgsrc ;-)</p>  <p>His mail contains also some bad things about this packaging system, although the list is very short. Followups to this email list some more items on the negative side.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
