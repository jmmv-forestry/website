I couldn't keep up with my plans yesterday.  I started by walking through the Golden Gate Bridge (both ways) and then, on my way back, I ended up visiting Japantown and the area around the City Hall.  I mean, I didn't visit the Golden Gate Park itself... but not a big deal since it seems similar to Central Park according to the maps.<br /><br />At night, I met just one NetBSD developer in the 21st Amendment bar.<br /><br />244 more photos to process.<br /><br />Today, time to visit the Berkeley campus.
