I've been told today about the <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/">Piled Higher and Deeper</a> website, also known as phdcomics (easier to remember).  And so far I'm hooked.  I love this comic strip!  May it be because I'm already involved in the research area due to my PFC and I know what they are talking about?  Possibly.  And it also illustrates what I can "expect" if I finally enroll in a Ph.D. course.
