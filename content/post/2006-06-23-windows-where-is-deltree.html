If you were a MSDOS user as I was, you may remember one of the useful novelties in the 5.0 version: an utility to delete whole directory hierarchies.  It was known as deltree.  That tool came really useful to avoid launching third party applications such as PC-Tools or PC-Shell (if I remember their names correctly).<br /><br />What a surprise when I needed it a year ago while working in Windows XP and couldn't find it anywhere; it certainly existed in Windows 9x!  Where is it?  Well, it simply does not exist any more.<br /><br />So, how can you delete whole directory trees from the Windows XP command line?  Just use the rmdir command.  Its <tt>/s</tt> option can be specified to ask it to recursively delete directories.  And the <tt>/q</tt> flag comes helpful to avoid the multiple and annoying "Are you sure?" questions.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, deltree ceased to exist in Windows 2000.  And yes: I have been meaning to post this message for almost a year!
