During the last couple of days, I've been working on the main major change planned for the upcoming ATF 0.3 release: the ability to generate XML reports with the tests results so that they can later be converted to HTML.<br /><br />It goes like this: you first run a test suite by means of the atf-run tool, then use the atf-report utility to convert atf-run's output to the new XML format and at last use a standard XSLT processor to transform the document to whichever other format you want.  I'm including sample XSLT and CSS style-sheets in the package to ease this process.<br /><br />I've uploaded <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/nbtests.html">an example of what this currently looks like</a>, but be aware that this is still a very preliminary mockup.  For example, adding more details for failed stuff is needed to ease debugging later on.  Comments welcome!
