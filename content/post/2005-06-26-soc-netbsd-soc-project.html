<a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">The NetBSD Project</a> has set up a project at the <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a> site that aims to centralize the development of the eight projects chosen for the <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a> program.  Its name is <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/">NetBSD-SoC</a> and its page contains information about all the elected projects, information about mailing lists of interest and a CVS repository for the students and their mentors. Read the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Foundation/press/soc.html">official announcement</a> for more information.  <p>As regards my project, I'll start filling up its <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/tmpfs/">page in the site</a> when I've got access to it (probably tomorrow). BTW, all the other seven projects are really nice and I hope all of them to be "finished" (or mostly working) by the end of the summer.</p>  <p>From here, I'd like to thank the NetBSD developers who made this possible, specially <a href="http://www.feyrer.de/">Hubert Feyrer</a> who has been working intensively in setting up the NetBSD-SoC project.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
