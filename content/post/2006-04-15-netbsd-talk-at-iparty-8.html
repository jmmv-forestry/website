I've been invited to give a talk about NetBSD on Saturday 22nd at the eighth <a href="http://iparty.aditel.org/">iParty</a>.  iParty is a set of FOSS-related activities hold at Castell√≥n de la Plana, Spain, which includes conferences, workshops and competitions.<br /><br />I'll start with an general introduction to NetBSD to later focus on development issues: how to contribute to the project and what needs to be done; I expect it to be somewhat technical.  The reason behind this choice is that Google is preparing the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code 2006</a> and it would be really nice to have more students than past year working for NetBSD.  The more students available, the higher chance NetBSD gets more work done!
