The file systems documentation <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/01/file-systems-documentation-for-review.html">I described yesterday</a> has been uploaded to NetBSD's website alongside with <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/index.html">all the documentation</a>.<br /><br />You can read the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Changes/#netbsd-internals-added">official announcement</a> or <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/internals/en/">go straight to the book</a>!  You'll notice that it is now prettier than the version posted yesterday because it properly uses NetBSD's stylesheet.
