If you use sudo for, e.g. pkgsrc's just-in-time su, you may have often bitten by the problem that some compilations are slow and the build process stops right in the middle to ask you for a root password.  If you go away while the system compiles, you'll be frustrated when you come back, as the process may still well be at the very beginning.<br /><br />This happens because, unless disabled by the system administrator, your sudo credentials last for 5 minutes. If you hadn't used sudo for those 5 minutes, it will ask you for your password again. A simple workaround for the problem is to automatically renew your credentials, say, every 2 minutes. You can do this by running the following command (from the same console you are using later on!) right before starting a pkgsrc build:<pre>$ ( while :; do sudo -v; sleep 120; done ) &</pre>
