I've just published the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20071111-atf-0-3-released">0.3 release of ATF</a>.  I could have delayed it indefinitely (basically because my time is limited now), so I decided it was time to do it even if it did not include some things I wanted.<br /><br />The important thing here is that this release will most likely be the one to be merged into the NetBSD source tree. If all goes well, this will happen during this week.  Which finally will give a lot of exposure to the project :-)
