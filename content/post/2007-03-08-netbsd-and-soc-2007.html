Yes, ladies and gentlemen: Google <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Changes/#soc200707">Summer of Code</a> 2007 is here and <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a> is going to become a mentoring organization again (unless Google rejected the application, that is)!<br /><br />We are preparing a list of <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-projects.html">projects suitable for SoC</a>; spend some time looking for one that interests you (I'm sure there is something) and get ready to send your proposal between the 14th and 24th of this same month.  I've already made my choice :-)<br /><br />See the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Changes/#soc200707">official announcement</a> for more details.
