Out of boredom, I installed MS-DOS and Windows 3.1 on my machine a few days ago &mdash; yeah, I was inspired by the Hot Dog Stand comments <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/09/9301047.aspx">in this post</a>.  Check it out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=51162&l=cd240&id=690369819">here</a>.  Don't be scared, it was just a virtual machine!<br /><br />Anyway, this was fun because it reminded me of something.  Back in 1994, my father bought a Pentium 60Mhz.  After ordering it, we imagined how fast it could be compared to our older machine, a 386DX 40Mhz.  Based on magazine reviews of those days, we supposed that Windows 3.1 could start in 1 or 2 seconds.  But what a disappointment when we got the machine.  It certainly was faster than the 386, but it took many more seconds to start Windows.<br /><br />Now, trying this same thing on the Macbook Pro, Windows 3.1 actually starts in less than 1 second.  Finally, after almost 15 years, our thoughts have become true!
