<p>I'm proud to annouce the sixteenth version of <a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/">Buildtool</a> (0.16), the newest and coolest version ever published (hmm... this holds true for all new versions so far). Don't know what is it? Just go to the website and start reading!</p>  <p>This new version comes with lots of new features and bug fixes, developed during the previous five months. Yeah, I know... a very long delay since the previous version, but I haven't had enough time to sit down and publish a version; it's a very time consuming and error prone task. Without detailing it much, I've to: create the tarballs, upload them (to <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge</a>), create entries for the files, update the website to announce the new version, send an announcement to <a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/">Freshmeat</a>, update the NetBSD packages...  and post to this blog (this step is new in this version, hehe).</p>  <p>Hmm... I think I'll have to talk about why automake and autoconf are "bad"... to convince you of the joys of Buildtool ;-) But for now, you can read the <a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/index.html">manual</a>, and in particular, the <a href="http://buildtool.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/devtut.html">developer's tutorial</a>.  Have fun!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
