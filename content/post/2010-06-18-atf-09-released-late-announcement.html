Oops! Looks like I forgot to announce the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf/news.html#20100603-atf-0-9-released">release of ATF 0.9</a> here a couple of weeks ago. Just a short notice that the formal release has been available since June 3rd and that 0.9 has been in NetBSD since June 4th!<br /><br />You can also enjoy a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf/">shiny-new web site</a>! It even includes a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/atf/docs/faq.html">FAQ</a>!<br /><br />And, as a side note: I have added a <tt>test</tt> target to the NetBSD Makefiles, so now it's possible to just do <tt>make test</tt> within any subdirectory of <tt>src/tests/</tt> and get what you expect.
