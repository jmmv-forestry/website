Just finished watching <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/">Jericho</a>'s first season, aired during the summer on the Spanish <a href="http://www.telecinco.es/">Tele 5</a> channel. What an incredible drama show!  It has all ingredients to keep you hooked: well balanced characters, good acting and scenery, lots of action and, of course, a good dose of suspense (OK, not as much as in Lost, but that's exaggerate).  It is a pity it was cancelled and, after looking at their site, I don't really understand if there will be a second season or not; I hope there'll be.<br /><br />And yeah... I think it's hard to avoid comparing this show with 24 (hmm, sixth season starting on Thursday here), specially when Hawkins is in action.  Just watch it and you'll probably understand this point ;-)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
