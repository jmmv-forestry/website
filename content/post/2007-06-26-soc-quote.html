I've already spent a bunch of time working on the packaging (as in what will end up in the .tar.gz distribution files) of <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/atf/">atf</a> even though it is still in very preliminary stages of development.  This involved:<br /><ul><li>Preparing a clean and nice build framework, which due to the tools I'm using meant writing the <tt>configure.ac</tt> and <tt>Makefile.am</tt> files.  This involved adding some useful comments and, despite I'm familiar with these tools, <i>re-reading</i> part of the <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html">GNU Automake</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/">GNU Autoconf</a> manuals; this last step is something that many, many developers bypass and therefore end up with really messy scripts as if they weren't important.  (Read: if the package used some other tools, there'd be no reason to not write pretty and clean build files.)<br /></li><li>Preparing the package's documentation, or at least placeholders for it: I'm referring to the typical <tt>AUTHORS</tt>, <tt>COPYING</tt>, <tt>NEWS</tt>, <tt>README</tt> and <tt>TODO</tt> documents that many developers seem to treat as garbage and fill them up at the last minute before flushing out a release, ending with badly formatted texts full of typos.  Come on, that's the very first thing a user will see after unpacking a distribution file, so these ought to be pretty!</li></ul>Having spent a lot of time packaging software for <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> and dealing with source code from other projects, I have to say that I've found dozens of packages that do not have the minimum quality one can expect in the above points.  I don't like to pinpoint, but I have to: this includes several GNOME packages and the libspe.  This last one is fairly "interesting" because the user documentation for it is high-quality, but all the credibility slips away when you look at the source code packaging...<br /><br />To all those authors:<br /><blockquote>“Programs should be written and polished until they acquire publication quality.” &mdash; Niklaus Wirth</blockquote>
