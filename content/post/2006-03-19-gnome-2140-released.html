OK, I know this comes late but I had to publish it. <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.14/">GNOME 2.14.0</a> was <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2006-March/msg00053.html">published a few days ago</a>. As happens with all other major releases in the 2.x series, this one comes with several improvements and tons of bug fixes. Note that these are not "very big" changes; they can be seen as minor refinements over the previous version, aiming for a better user experience. You can check <a href="http://www.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/03/17/0350228">this review</a> for more information.<br /><br />I have alread played with this version in its full power: I installed Ubuntu Dapper to get it up and running in few hours, resulting in a fully working desktop environment.  (I think I'm leaving KDE again ;-)<br /><br />Now I'm dealing with the update in pkgsrc; I've almost got the <tt>gnome-base</tt> package up to date, so I hope to be able to boot into this new version tomorrow or so.  Thanks to the currently running package freeze, I can work on the update without interferences for a period of two weeks in which I hope to get the new version running, shake out some bugs and feed some patches back.  I hate to see some packages such as <tt>gnome-vfs2</tt> or <tt>libgtop2</tt> with lots of local patches, as they are almost unmaintenable.<br /><br />(I know, I know... the freeze is aimed at solving bugs.  But I do this big update now that I have some-but-not-much free time or I won't be able to do it.)
