Some long-standing bug fixes / improvements have gone in this week:<br /><ul><li>Improvements to the cleanup routine, which is used to destroy the work directory of a test case after the test case has terminated:</li><ul><li>Heavy refactoring to be tolerant to failures. These failures may arise when a child of the test case does not exit immediately and holds temporary files in the work directory open for longer than expected.</li><li>Any file systems that the test case leaves mounted within the work directory will now be unmounted, just as the ATF test interface mandates. I realize that this adds a lot of complexity to the runtime engine for very little gain. If/when we revise the tests interface, it will be worth to reconsider this and maybe leave the cleanup of mounted file systems to the test case altogether.</li><li>As a result, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=17">issue 17</a> has been fixed!</li></ul><li>Kyua now captures common termination signals (such as SIGINT) and exits in a controlled manner. What this means is that Kyua will now kill any active test programs and clean up any existing work directories before exiting. What this also means is that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/detail?id=4">issue 4</a> is fixed.</li></ul>To increase amusements, a little FYI: the above points have never worked correctly in ATF, and the codebase of ATF makes it extremely hard to implement them right. I have to confess that it has been tricky to implement the above in Kyua as well, but I feel much more confident in that the implementation works well. Of course, there may be some corner cases left... but, all in all, it's more robust and easier to manage.<br /><br />The list of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=Milestone%3DRelease0.1+&amp;colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&amp;cells=tiles">pending tasks for 0.1</a> shortens!<br /><ul></ul>
