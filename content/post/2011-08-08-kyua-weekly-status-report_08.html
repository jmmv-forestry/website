<br /><ul><li>Added the ability to explicitly define timeouts for plain test programs. This just completes the work from past week that made running plain test programs at all but had an ugly TODO in it to implement this missing feature.</li>
<li>The bootstrap test suite now runs as a single test case within the whole Kyua test suite. Demonstrates the plain test programs interface functionality :-)</li>
<li>Started reshuffling code to make the &lt;tt&gt;--config&lt;/tt&gt; and related flags program-wide. The goal is to allow the configuration file to tune the behavior of all of Kyua, so these flags must be made generic. They were previously specific to the &lt;tt&gt;test&lt;/tt&gt; subcommand only.</li>
</ul>
