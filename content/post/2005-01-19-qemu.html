<p>Today, I decided to try the <a href="http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/">QEMU</a> CPU emulator. I installed it and, after fighting several problems caused by incorrect flags passed to the compiler, I got it working.</p>  <p>So I tried to install OS/2 Warp 4 as the client OS.  The emulator is <i>very</i> fast, compared to others such as <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs</a> (yeah, well, they don't work the same way). I had some problems during the installation (strange crashes in the installer) but, after disabling the network installation, it seems to work properly now.</p>  <p>Hmm... I haven't been able to run this OS in any other emulator :-)  It's really worth trying.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
