I am pleased to tell you that ATF 0.2 has just been released!  This is the first non-SoC release coming exactly after a month from the 0.1 release, which means that the project is still alive :-)<br /><br />This is just a quick note.  For more details please see the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20070920-atf-0-2-released">official announcement</a>.  Enjoy!
