During the course of this year, I have experimented with writing internal
long-form "opinion" posts at Google.  In doing so, I have also experimented
with posting such content in Google+ instead of in a blog, and the results
have been quite satisfying: content posted in this way received much more
engagement than a post hosting just a link to an equivalent external
document.

Unfortunately, Google+'s formatting features are extremely limited, and
composing such long posts within its editor is painful.  For this reason,
I wrote a tool called `md2gplus` which would take a Markdown-formatted
document with limited markup and convert it to a Google+ post.  This tool
has been helpful in making it easier for me to write such articles and
also has improved the visual quality of the results.

Today, I am open-sourcing the `md2gplus` tool under the **Markdown2Social
project** and you can find it both in GitHub and in PyPI:

> <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/markdown2social/>

This new tool is very rudimentary and of very limited usage, but I hope
you might find it useful!  If you do, please [let me know](/about).
