As a present for my saint (I don't know if this is the proper expression in English) &mdash; which I celebrate today due to my second name (Manuel) &mdash; I got a <a href="http://www.benq-eu.com/Products/LCD/index.cfm?product=589">BenQ FP202W</a> flat panel.  It's a 20" wide screen, providing a 16:10 aspect ration at its native resolution of 1680x1050 pixels.  This contrasts heavily with my now-old <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktopdisplays/crtmonitors/e2series/e70f/">Viewsonic E70f</a>, a 17" CRT doing only 1024x768@85Hz.<br /><br />And man, this new monitor is <i>truly amazing</i>.  Maximizing windows is a thing of the past!  (Except for the media player, of course ;)  Being able to have two documents open side by side is great: for example, you can keep your editor in one side while reading a reference manual in the other side without having to constantly switch between windows; and even then, there is still room for other things.  Moreover, playing Half-Life 2 in widescreen mode is... great :)<br /><br />I've also tried to plug it to the iBook G4; it works fine for most things but feels a bit sluggish when some effects come into the game (aka, Expos√© or Dashboard).  Looks like its video card is not powerful enough to handle it flawlessy (something I can understand).  I ought to try its clamshell mode, though, as disabling its builtin screen may make it faster; but first I need to get a USB keyboard...<br /><br />Concluding: while the old CRT monitor was still in perfect working condition, the switch has been great.  I don't know why I hesitated to do it ;)  If you have the money to buy such a display, I certainly recommend it.<br /><br />Happy new year 2006!
