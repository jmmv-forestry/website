To conclude the development of ATF as part of SoC, I've released a 0.1 version coinciding with the coding deadline (later today).  This clearly draws a line between what has been done during the SoC program and what will be done afterwards.<br /><br />See the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/atf/news.html#20070820-atf-0-1-released">official announcement</a> for more details!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it as much as I did working on it.
