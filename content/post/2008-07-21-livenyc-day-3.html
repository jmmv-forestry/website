Today I spent most part of the day at Google.  I took a tour through the offices, dealt with paperwork and chatted with my boss.  I don't know what things I can say about what I saw, so I will only mention one thing: the place is great.  Looks like it'll be hard to leave when the internship finishes!<div><br /></div><div>Later this evening, I went shopping to Whole Foods per a suggestion from my boss.  Everything in there seems pretty darn expensive but also of good quality.  And the place was incredibly crowded.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ah, and one more thing that surprised me about the city and that I forgot to mention yesterday: almost everyone who rides bikes wears a helmet.  That's "hard" (not uncommon, just not typical) to see in Barcelona.</div><div><br /></div><div>Last random note: my annoying journey to look for housing continues...</div>
