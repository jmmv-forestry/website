Dear readers,<br /><br />I am pleased to announce that Kyua 0.3 is available!<br /><br />The major feature in this release is the introduction of the "test results store"; i.e. a SQLite3-based database that records all test execution activity so that reports can be gathered in a central machine and reports generated out of it.  This is still very experimental and the generated reports are quite rudimentary, but is a first step towards this direction.<br /><br />The <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/downloads/detail?name=kyua-cli-0.3.tar.gz">Kyua 0.3 release page</a> provides links to the download as well as the list of major changes in this new release.<br /><br />It has been a really long time since the 0.2 release.  I wanted to postpone 0.3 until HTML reports were ready, but I have not had the time to implement this for a while already.  Instead of postponing the release even further, I have decided to create it right now and then take the time to create nice reports separately.  Additionally, I am planning on <a href="{{< relref "2012-02-11-switching-projects-to-git.html" >}}">doing some repository changes</a> and wanted to do them without an imminent release along the way.<br /><br />The package in pkgsrc has been updated and now I'm working on bringing binary packages to Fedora.<br /><br />Enjoy!
