I am very proud to annouce that I have been accepted into Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a> program &mdash; <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/06/soc-accepted.html">again</a>!  During Summer 2005 I developed an efficient, memory-based file system for the NetBSD operating system, baptized <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/tmpfs/">tmpfs</a>.  I must confess that I enjoyed <i>very much</i> hacking the NetBSD kernel and also learned a lot about file systems.<br /><br />So this year I was eager to repeat the experience by taking part in SoC again.  In order to ensure my participation, I thoroughly prepared three applications for three different projects.  I had a hard time making the choices because there were tons of interesting projects (which could have taught me very different skills), but at last decided for the following:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/soc2006/grub.txt">Application 1</a>: Add complete NetBSD support to <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB 2</a>.  I chose this project because I knew I could do it, but mostly because I wanted to ensure that GRUB 2 had first-class support for BSD operating systems.  GRUB currently lacks features to correctly boot these, which is a nuisance.  After sending the application, I was quickly contacted by a GRUB developer telling me that there was another student willing to work on this project, and that he did not knew what to do.  I offered to leave my spot to the other developer, hoping to capture another potential NetBSD hacker.</li><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/soc2006/boost.txt">Application 2</a>: Develop a <a href="http://www.crystalclearsoftware.com/cgi-bin/boost_wiki/wiki.pl?BoostProcess">process management library</a> for <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>.  This is something I have had in mind since February 2005, when I first discovered Boost.  I was planning to do this as my final computer science degree next Spring, but applied for it now so that I could free myself from this idea.  (I have other projects in mind that are currently blocked by the lack of Boost.Process.)</li><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/~jmmv/soc2006/netbsd.txt">Application 3</a>: Improve NetBSD's <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html#regression-framework">regression testing framework</a>.  After looking at the list of suggested projects for NetBSD and evaluating them, I felt that working on this area could have been very useful for the project, improving its overall quality; I like and enjoy writing software that is able to test itself as much as possible.</li></ul>The decision between the Boost and NetBSD projects was quite hard to make, so I opted to send both in and let luck decide.  Strictly speaking, I stated in my applications that I preferred to do the Boost project for several reasons and I guess Google made their choice based on that.  But do not get me wrong: I enjoyed very much the time I spent hacking NetBSD, and I hope to continue doing so in the near future.<br /><br />Summarizing: I will be developing the Boost.Process library this summer!  See the links above for more some information: the wiki page holds some ideas about its design and the application lists my reasons to want to work on this.<br /><br />I now feel sorry for not "being able" to work on NetBSD's regression testing framework.  I do not know if anybody else has been picked to work on it, but if not, this project seems doomed...  It was choosen past year but the student abandoned it half-way.  This year it was also choosen by NetBSD but Google preferred me to work on Boost.  However... while writing the application, my interest in this project raised, which means that I may retake it in the future if nobody else does; maybe as my CS final degree project? :-)<br /><br />Now... stay tuned for further news on Boost.Process!
