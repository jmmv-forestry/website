<p>As usual, the latest stable version of the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Platform and Desktop, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.12/">2.12.1</a>, has been integrated into <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>. It has been a tough job due to all the affected packages and comes a bit late, compared to all the previous updates, but I hope you'll enjoy it.</p><p>Please see the <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-pkg/2005/10/16/0008.html">official announcement</a> for more information.</p>
