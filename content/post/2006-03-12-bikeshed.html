Don't know what a "bikeshedded discussion" is?  <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/misc.html#BIKESHED-PAINTING">This FAQ</a> from FreeBSD explains it well enough.  I like this sentence in special: "<i>the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change</i>".<br /><br />It's a pity it happens too often in (Net)BSD mailing lists.
