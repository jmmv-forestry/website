The NetBSD Project recently launched a new <a href="http://blog.netbsd.org/">official blog for NetBSD</a>. From here, I'd like to invite you to visit it and <a href="http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/feed/entries/atom">subscribe to it</a>. It's only with your support (through reading and, specially, <i>commenting</i>) that developers will post more entries!  Enjoy :-)
