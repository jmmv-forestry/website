<p>Software is not perfect. When using it you'll eventually hit bugs, some of which may be trivial, like a typo, or very annoying (crashes, broken features, etc.). Reporting them is a good way to help developers, and you can do it even if you are not a coder.</p>  <p>But you should be careful when reporting a bug. If they are repeated, incomplete, or are not really bug reports, they can annoy developers (and that's not what you want to do ;).</p>  <p>So, when hitting a problem, the first thing to do is to check if you have the latest version of the program; if not, update it and check if the bug still exists.</p>  <p>The next step is to verify if the problem is already reported.  Some bug trackers, like <a href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>, have excellent search features; others, like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnats/">GNATS</a>, are not so powerful.  Anyway you should be able to find similar bugs easily, if they exist.</p>  <p>If the bug is not in the database, open a new bug report. Try to fill in as much information as possible. This includes: a complete description of the problem, a description of hardware and/or software that may be related to the problem (including version numbers, external patches, etc.), an explanation about how to reproduce the bug (non-reproducible bugs are very difficult to verify and fix) and, if you have enough knowledge, a suggested fix for the problem (in the form of a patch file, usually). Keep in mind that reports that lack information are (very) annoying.</p>  <p>If the bug is already in the database, just check if it's complete or not and add any (additional) information that may be missing. <i>Do not open a new report for the same issue</i>, please.</p>  <p>Another tip: do not use bug reports to propose new ideas; they are very difficult to handle. Try to discuss these in a mailing list first and, if people likes your proposal, then open a bug report. Also avoid using bug reports to ask questions; these should go to mailing lists too.</p>  <p>Start reporting easy and simple problems, but try to report everything you find. You'll only improve your style with practice ;) And doing this, you'll be helping a (free) software project!</p>  <p>For some examples, you can check my list of <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&amp;long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&long_desc=&amp;status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&status_whiteboard=&amp;keywords_type=anywords&keywords=&amp;emailassigned_to1=1&emailreporter1=1&amp;emailtype1=exact&email1=jmmv%40menta.net&amp;emailtype2=substring&email2=&amp;bugidtype=include&bug_id=&amp;changedin=&chfieldfrom=&amp;chfieldto=Now&chfieldvalue=&amp;cmdtype=doit&namedcmd=My+open+bugs&amp;newqueryname=&order=Bug+Number&amp;field0-0-0=noop&type0-0-0=noop&amp;value0-0-0=">GNOME</a> bugs.  Or search my surname in the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/query-pr.html">NetBSD Problem Database</a> to check my bugs there (I can't add a direct link, so you'll have to do the search manually...).  Have fun!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
