Apple has just published <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>, a utility to install Windows XP on a Mac.  As I understand it, this provides an EFI module for legacy BIOS compatibility, a set of Windows drivers for the Apple hardware and the required tools to ease Windows' installation.<br /><br />In other words: it lets you to flawlessly install Windows XP SP2 (be it the Home or Professional edition) in one of the new Intel-based Macs.  Beta versions are now available for downloaded and the final version will be included in Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard.<br /><br />Great, Apple.  I do not have an excuse any more to not replace my desktop machine with a Macintosh.  In fact, I'm dying to switch but I'll resist for some more time ;-)<br /><br /><b>Edit (April 7th, 20:57)</b>: Dirk Olbertz has installed <a href="http://perkypants.org/blog/2006/04/06/ubuntu-boot-camp/">Ubuntu on his iMac</a> using Boot Camp (the link is in German).  So this seems not to be restricted to Windows.
