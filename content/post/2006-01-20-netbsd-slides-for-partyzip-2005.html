The  <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/advocacy/partyzipa2005.pdf">slides I used for the NetBSD conference</a> at <a href="http://www.partyzipa.com/">PartyZIP@</a> 2005 are now available at the NetBSD website.  These shoud have been uploaded to PartyZIP@'s site as well as some recordings about the conferences, but this hasn't been done yet &mdash; and this <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/06/netbsd-conference-at-partyzip.html">happened in July</a>.  Hope you find them of some interest ;-)  Note that they are in Spanish.
