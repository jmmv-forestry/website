Thanks to Antti Kantee's efforts, atf is seeing increasing visibility in the NetBSD community during the past few months. But one of the major concerns that we keep hearing from our developers is "Where is the documentation?".  Certainly I have been doing a pretty bad job at that, and the current in-tree documents are a bit disorganized.<br /><br />To fix the short-term problem, I have written a <a href="http://wiki.NetBSD.org/tutorials/atf/">little tutorial</a> that covers pretty much every aspect that you need to know to write atf tests and, in particular, how to write such tests for the NetBSD source tree.  Please refer to the <a href="http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/new_tutorial_creating_atf_based">official announcement</a> for more details.<br /><br />Comments are, of course, welcome!  And if you can use this tutorial to write your first tests for NetBSD, let me know :-)
