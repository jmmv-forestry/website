The <a href="http://www.cursabombers.com/">Cursa Bombers</a> is a 10km-long race that takes place in Barcelona city.  Today, it has been celebrated for the 9th consecutive year with a record in the number of participants: almost 13,000.<br /><br />As I told you a long time ago, <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2004/10/do-you-run.html">I enjoy running</a> so I decided to take part in this race.  The event started at 10:00 in the morning and lasted a maximum of an hour and 20 minutes.<br /><br />It took me 46'39" to finish it and ended up in the 4156 position; not that bad, considering that I haven't trained running for a while.  The breakdown is:<br /><ul><li>Absolute time of arrival: 48'49"</li><li>Real time to completion: 46'39"</li><li>Absolute position: 4156th (considering the absolute time)<br /></li><li>Corrected position: 3857th (considering the real time)<br /></li><li>Category and position within it: Male senior, 1917th</li><li>Average time per km: 4'40"</li><li>Position and time at first checkpoint (2,5km): 5531th, 14'34"</li><li>Position and time at second checkpoint (5km): 4973th, 27'02"</li><li>Position and time at third checkpoint (7,5km): 4456th, 34'46" </li></ul>  It is the first race I run but it has been very enjoyable and exciting.  I'm already looking forward to the next one!
