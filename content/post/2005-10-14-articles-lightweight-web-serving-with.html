<p>Several months ago I started writing an article about setting up and using the lightweight web server <a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/">thttpd</a>, focusing on the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> operating system.  I finally decided to finish it a month ago and submitted it for publication.  You can now <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2005/10/13/thttpd.html">read it on-line</a> at <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp</a>.</p>  <p>Hope you find it useful!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
