Quoting <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> news:<br /><blockquote>As the remaining awards are being distributed and the t-shirts are being prepped to ship out, we thought we'd give you an idea of the both the global scope and the hard work done by the students and mentors during the <a href="http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html">Summer of Code</a>. We've put together a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc-map.html">map</a> and a <a href="http://code.google.com/soc-results.html">list of projects</a> for your examination. Please note that not all of the projects are listed quite yet, but we wanted to share some info with the people who follow this site.</blockquote>It has taken a while, but the projects and results are finally announced.  There certainly is a lot of interesting stuff in the list :-)
