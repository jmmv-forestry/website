<p>These days, I'm very busy working with a friend in a game which we have to have "finished" by next Friday (it's university work). Basically, it is a three-dimensional Pacman with multi-player support, licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> and written in C++.  It will be released on <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">Sourceforge.net</a> in a while, so keep tuned ;) Anyway, the purpose of this message is to publish some recent news, as I had no time during the week to do so:</p>  <p>On Wednesday 8th, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">The GNOME Project</a> released the <a href="http://gnomedesktop.org/node/2078">2.8.2</a> version of its desktop environment (including the developer platform and the bindings). This is the continuation of the stable <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.8/">2.8</a> branch, including a large number of bug fixes and minor improvements.  Check the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2004-December/msg00026.html">list of changes</a> for more information.</p>  <p>ATM, <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>'s code-base is freezed in order to prepare the next stable branch, <i>pkgsrc-2004Q4</i>. The freeze will last for at most two weeks, so GNOME 2.8.2 will not be integrated until it finishes (and, anyway, I don't have time to do The Big Update (TM) right now :-/).</p>  <p>And, to finish this post... on Wednesday 9th, we, <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">The NetBSD Project</a>, released <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Changes/#netbsd-2.0">NetBSD 2.0</a>! Wohooo! You should get this new release right now! Featuring native kernel-level threads, kqueue, SMP (on amd64, i386, macppc, sparc...), systrace, verified exec, <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> 3.3.3, <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> 4.4.0, support for new platforms, innumerable bug fixes and many, many more things that you'll have to discover by yourself. Give a try to this free and fantastic operating system! ;-) &lt;/hype&gt;</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
