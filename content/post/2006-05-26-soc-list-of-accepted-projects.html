After some days of delay, Google has published the final list of chosen projects for this year's Summer of Code; it consists of <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">630 funded projects</a>.  If you browse through them, you will find <i>lots</i> of interesting things.  The good thing is that most of them will be worked on seriously, so there will be great contributions by the end of the summer :-)<br /><br />As I told you, my project is listed under the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/boost/about.html">Boost page</a> alongside other interesting projects.  It looks like Boost will get a lot of new work — and contributors — this summer.  At least, this is the case for me: I am not very involved with Boost development yet.<br /><br />Also take a look at the <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/">NetBSD-SoC</a> page, which lists all projects chosen by NetBSD.  At first I was sorry to abandon my slot in favour of the Boost one.  But now that I have seen the project that took it, I am happy; it is something really needed.  I won't tell you which it is because all of them are equally interesting! ;-)
