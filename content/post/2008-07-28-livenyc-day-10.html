Not much to say today other than I was lazy to go running in the morning and that I have finally settled on an apartment. Will move in on Friday as long as I can figure out how to do the payment! Â (Probably need to deal with money orders, because I can't really get enough cash.)<div><br /></div><div>Also, I think the time when I'm assigned a project at Google is approaching. Hope it will be soon.</div>
