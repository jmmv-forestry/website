Let's face it.  If you are a software developer, you have certainly felt some time that code developed by others was a real mess and that you could do a much better job rewriting it from scratch (specially without actually understanding the "messy" code in detail).  Big mistake.<br /><br />I'm not going to explain here why because the <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/fog0000000069.html">Things You Should Never Do, Part I</a> article from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> talks about this in great detail.  Certainly worth to read.
