<p>Writing is one of my hobbies and you can access all of my articles,
papers, and essays online.  This hobby started a long time ago and
matured with <a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/">The Julipedia</a>, my
former blog, which I begain in June 2004 and that was subsumed into this
site on May 2016 <!--TODO(jmmv): Add post to announcement. -->.</p>
