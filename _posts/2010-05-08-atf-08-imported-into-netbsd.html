Finished <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2010/05/08/msg009703.html">importing ATF 0.8 into the NetBSD source tree</a>.  Wow, the CVS import plus merge was much easier than I expected.<div><br /></div><div>Note that, while the NetBSD test suite should continue to work as usual, there are some backwards incompatible changes in the command line interface of test programs.  If you are used to run them by hand, expect different results.  Please read the <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/news.html#20100507-atf-0-8-released">release news</a> for details.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Now let's wait for complaints about broken builds!  And enjoy this new release in your NetBSD-current system!</div></div>
