<p>As I commented a while ago, I got a Macintosh Performa 630. Fortunately for me, it came with a regular Ethernet network card; it kinda worked with the Mac OS that came installed with the machine (7.something). However, since I zapped the disk and installed MacOS 8.1, I haven't been able to get the card working again... until today.</p>  <p>I've been pointed out that I could be lacking the drivers. Oh, drivers... how is that I never realized that? (May it be because I rarely use Windows? ;-) Anyway, I took out the motherboard and watched at the NIC's labels to see which one I have. According to multiple diffferent inscriptions, I concluded that its name is <i>DaynaPORT E/CS-T</i>.  So a quick search in <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> revealed several links pointing to <a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>.  I was surprised to see that, but later I realized that Intel bought Dayna Communications Inc. a while ago.</p>  <p>Once in the page, I downloaded the drivers and installed them on the Mac OS 8.1.   Surprise surprise, it works!  Now I have <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmmv/1182.html">network (and Internet!) access from the Macintosh</a>, which means I can easily copy files to it; i.e., NetBSD's installation files (what I'm playing with ATM).</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
