Dear readers,<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">2011 is here so...</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Happy new year!</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b><br /></b></div><div style="text-align: left;">I hope you all are having a nice holiday season and enjoyed the new year's eve celebration, should it be something special for you.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">My tentative resolutions for this year related to non-work and non-personal areas would be:</div><div style="text-align: left;"><ul><li>First, to revive this blog. I have been lately posting more frequently than has been usual and it has been a pleasant task. I would like to recover the habit of blogging several times per week and, for that, I need topics! Keep'em coming! I already have some topics on the queue but they need a bit of research on my side first.</li><li>Second, to bring <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/">Kyua</a> to reality (i.e. to deprecate <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/">ATF</a>). Work is continuing intensively and a preliminary release should be ready during Q1. This release will bring the much-needed replacement for <tt>atf-run</tt>.</li><li>And third... well, haven't thought that much about resolutions ;-) We will see.</li></ul></div>
