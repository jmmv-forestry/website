<ul><li>Moved the code of <tt>utils::lua</tt> to a new project, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lutok/">Lutok</a>.</li><li>Attempted to integrate a copy of Lutok into the Kyua source code to simplify installing Kyua. I have been playing with Subversion externals and Autoconf/Automake hacks to make this happen, but unfortunately haven't got a pleasant solution yet.</li><li>Modified Lutok to not expose the Lua C API at all from header files and cleaned up the Kyua code to cope with the changes.</li><li>Been chewing through the first chapters of the "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-SQLite-Jay-Kreibich/dp/0596521189">Using SQLite</a>" book to refresh my SQL skills. </li><li>And, most importantly, wrote a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/wiki/DatabaseDesign">preliminary design document for the database store</a> of Kyua and the reporting features. Comments certainly welcome! Be aware that this is how <tt>atf-report</tt> will be replaced, so once this is done we should be able to finally kill <tt>atf-run</tt> and <tt>atf-report</tt> altogether :-)</li></ul>
