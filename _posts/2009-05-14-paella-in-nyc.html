These days, I'm starting to cook by myself (aka learning) and yesterday I made paella for 6 people while staying in NYC (leaving on Sunday...).  This is the third time in two weeks that I cook this Spanish dish, but I think the results were pretty good despite the lack of ingredients.  After all, cooking is not as hard as I originally thought!  And it's pretty fun too!<br /><br />Just blogging this because the results look nice:<br /><br /><div style='text-align:center;margin:0px auto 10px;'><a href='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/SgxglPObEeI/AAAAAAAAC5Q/na0_iEsVnAY/s1600-h/IMG_1329.JPG'><img src='/images/2009-05-14-IMG_1329.JPG' border='0' alt='' /></a>&nbsp;</div>P.S. I'm now eating the leftovers from yesterday. Yummm! :-)
