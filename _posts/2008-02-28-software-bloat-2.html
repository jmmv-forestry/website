A long while ago &mdash; just before buying the MacBook Pro &mdash; I already <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/12/software-bloat.html">complained about software bloat</a>.  A year and two months later, it is time to complain again.<br /><br />I am thinking on renewing my MacBook Pro assuming I can sell this one for a good price.  The reasons for this are to get slightly better hardware (more disk, better GPU and maybe 4GB of RAM) and software updates.  The problem is: if I am able to find a buyer, I will be left without a computer for some days, and that's not a good scenario.  I certainly don't want to order the new one without being certain that I will be paid enough for the current one.<br /><br />So yesterday I started assembling some old components I had lying around aiming at having an old but functional computer to work with.  But today I realized that I also had the PlayStation 3 with Fedora 8 already installed, and that it'd be enough to use as a desktop for a week or so.  I had trimmed down the installation to the bare minimum so that it'd boot as fast as possible and to leave free resources for testing Cell-related stuff.  But if I wanted to use the PS3 as a desktop, I needed, for example, GNOME.<br /><br />Ew.  Doing a <tt>yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop Environment"</tt> took quite a while, and not because of the network connection.  But even if we leave that aside, starting the environment was painful.  <i>Really</i> painful.  And Mono was not there, at all!  It is amazing how unusable the desktop is with "only" 256MB of RAM; the machine is constantly going to swap, and the disk being slow does not help either.  I still remember the days when 256MB was a lot, and desktop machines were snappy enough with only half of that, or even less.<br /><br />OK, so GNOME is a lot for 256MB of RAM.  I am now writing this from the PS3 itself running WindowMaker.  Which unfortunately does not solve all the problems &mdash; and the biggest one is that it is not a desktop environment.  Firefox also requires lots of resources to start, and doing something else in the background still makes the machine use swap.  (Note that I have disabled almost all of the system services enabled by default in Fedora, including SELinux.)<br /><br />If I finally sell my MBP, this will certainly be enough for a few days... but it's a pity to see how unusable it is.  (Yeah, by today's standards, the PS3 is extremely short on RAM, I know, but GNOME used to run quite well with this amount of RAM just a few years ago.)
