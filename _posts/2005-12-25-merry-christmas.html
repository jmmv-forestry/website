Merry Christmas, my fellow readers, and thanks for reading this blog!  Seizing the opportunity to post some numbers: since this blog was <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/10/blog-migrated-to-blogger-welcome.html">moved from Livejournal to Blogger</a> it has got around 2.300 unique visits.  This makes the 209th post and the blog has been up for 19 months; I think it's in good health.<br /><br />Oh, and I just got a <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Product_C2%26cid%3D1126536698937&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper">Linksys WRT54GS</a> broadband router as a Christmas present...  time to set it up :-)
