Yes, it is true!  (Although I haven't seen any anouncement yet; thanks to a friend for telling me.) <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>'s messaging service, <a href="http://talk.google.com/">Google Talk</a>, can now communicate with other <a href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> servers such as the popular jabber.org. It has always been a Jabber-based system, but its server didn't allow communications with third-party servers before.<br /><br />I think I'll migrate my account if this one proves to be stable; will be trying it for some days before to make sure :-)
