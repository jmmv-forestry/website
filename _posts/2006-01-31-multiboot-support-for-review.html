During the past few days I've continued to work on <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/12/multiboot-specification-and-netbsd.html">adding Multiboot support to NetBSD</a>.  It has been a hard task due to the lack of documentation &mdash; I had to reverse-engineer all the i386 boot code &mdash; but also <i>very</i> interesting: I've had to do deal with low-level code (recovering somewhat my ASM skills) and learn some details about <a href="http://www.skyfree.org/linux/references/ELF_Format.pdf">ELF</a> (see the <tt>copy_syms</tt> function in <tt>multiboot.c</tt> and you'll see why).<br /><br />You can now <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/jmmv/multiboot.diff">review the preliminary patch</a> and read the public <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2006/01/31/0007.html">request for review</a>.
