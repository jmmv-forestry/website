<p>While adding NFS support to tmpfs, I found how <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> currently manages NFS exports from userland. The interface is, IMHO, scary. As NetBSD aims for clean code and design, it must be fixed.</p>  <p>See my <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2005/09/11/0001.html">mail to the tech-kern@ mailing list</a> for more details on the issue and a preliminary patch.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
