This week:<div><ul><li>Cleaned up the internal code of the "list" command and added a few unit tests.</li><li>Added integration tests for the "test" command that focus mostly on the behavior of the "test" command itself. There is still a need for full integration tests that validate the execution of the test cases themselves and their cleanup, and these will be tricky to write.</li><li>Changed atf-c, atf-c++ and atf-sh to show a warning when a test program is run by hand. Users should really be using atf-run to execute the tests, or otherwise things like isolation or timeouts will not work (and they'll conclude that atf is broken!).</li></ul></div>
