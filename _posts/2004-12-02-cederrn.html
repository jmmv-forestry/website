<p>Did you know that <i>cederrón</i> is a correct word in Spanish, i.e., accepted by the <a href="http://www.rae.es/">RAE</a>?  Oh God, I couldn't believe it the first time I noticed this.</p>  <p>Why?  Just consider that <i>cederrón</i> comes from an <i>incorrect</i> pronunciation of the <i>CD-ROM</i> acronym.  I might like it if it was written with an "m", but not with an "n".  Do you imagine <i>ceedeerron</i> being an English word?  How ugly.</p>  <p>I'm also worried about the word <i>encriptar</i>, which does <i>not</i> exist in Spanish, but is used to refer to the English <i>encrypt</i> term.  If <i>encriptar</i> was a real word, it could mean "<i>to put something inside a crypt</i>", more or less.  But... as <i>lots</i> of people use it in speaking (and even writing!), one can expect that it will become an accepted word. However, be aware that we already have <i>cifrar</i> to refer to <i>encrypt</i>...  so why not use it?</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
