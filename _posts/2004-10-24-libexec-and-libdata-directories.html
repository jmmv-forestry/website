<p>Some time ago, a Linux-guy asked me what the <tt>libexec</tt> and <tt>libdata</tt> directories present on a BSD system (placed under <tt>/</tt>, <tt>/usr</tt>, or other top-level hierarchies) are, because he had never seen them before in his Linux box. So here is a detailed explanation.</p>  <p><tt>libexec</tt> is a directory that contains daemons and utilities that can't be used directly by the user. Simply put, they rely on other programs to launch them. For example:</p>  <ul> <li>The dynamic linker (<tt>/libexec/ld.elf_so</tt> in <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>) is placed in this directory because it is executed by the kernel whenever a new program is started. The user can't launch this program directly.</li>  <li>Simple daemons launched by inetd(8) are here because they can't be launched as standalone daemons. Consider telnetd(8), identd(8), etc.</li>  <li>Several parts of <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> (such as cc1, cc1obj, cc1plus, etc.) are here because there is no direct use for them.</li>  <li>All <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Panel applets are here because they rely on the Panel to launch them (so that they can be attached to the right bar).</li>  <li>Component providers, such as evolution-data-server, are also here because other applications have to launch them through Bonobo (or whatever).</li>  <li>And a large etcetera...</li> </ul>  <p>On the other hand, <tt>libdata</tt> holds static data files, which are used by other programs or libraries. This data is usually in binary format, not shareable across computers and/or not intended for direct use. Otherwise, it could simply go into <tt>share</tt>.  For example, in <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, we use this directory to store static databases, such as the one used by <a href="http://scrollkeeper.sourceforge.net/">ScrollKeeper</a> to index documentation, or the one used by <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/">GStreamer</a> to keep track of registered plugins.</p>  <p>But where does Linux store these files, if it does not use these hierarchies? It depends on the distribution. The most typical place is somewhere under the <tt>lib</tt> tree, in a subdirectory named after the package name.  (It may be that some distributions use these directories, though.)</p>  <p>Ah! Before saying that BSDs use strange trees... keep in mind that, by default, all scripts created by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">GNU Autoconf</a> default to these directories!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
