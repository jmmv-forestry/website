<ul><li>Implemented the "plain" test interface. This allows plugging "foreign test programs" into a Kyua-based test suite. (A foreign test program is a program that does not use any testing framework: it reports success and failure by means of an exit code.)</li><li>Generalized code between the atf and plain interfaces and did some cleanups.</li><li>Attempted to fix the ATF_REQUIRE_EQ macros in ATF to evaluate their arguments only once. This has proven to be tricky and therefore it is not done yet. At the moment, the macros reevaluate the arguments on a failure condition, which is not too big of a deal.</li></ul>
