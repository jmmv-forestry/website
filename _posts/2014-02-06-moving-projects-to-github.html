<p>For a couple of years or so, I have been hosting my open source projects in Google Code.  The time to jump ship has come.</p> <p>The major reason for this move is that <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html">Google Code stopped supporting file downloads</a> three weeks ago.  This is unfortunate given that "binary" releases are a must for proper software distribution.  Sure, I could use a third-party service like <a href="https://bintray.com/">Bintray</a> to offer the downloads, but I'd rather consolidate all project data in a single location.</p> <p>With this, <a href="https://github.com/jmmv">I am moving to GitHub</a>.  "<i>Why not &lt;insert-your-favorite-hosting&gt; though?</i>"  Because Google prefers us to put <a href="https://github.com/google">Google-sponsored open source projects in GitHub</a>, and all the work I do now is sponsored by my employer as part of my 20% time.  (Yes, 20% time still exists even if people out there may try to convince you otherwise.)</p> <p>GitHub was already hosting some projects of my own (including <a href="https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/introducing_sysbuild_and_sysupgrade">sysbuild and sysupgrade</a>), so the remaining (Lutok, ATF and Kyua) will move as well.  In fact, <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/lutok">Lutok was already moved</a> a few days ago as an experiment and <a href="https://github.com/jmmv/atf">I am working on ATF</a> as we speak.</p> <p>Moving Kyua will be a little bit trickier given that Kyua is composed of more than one Git repository.  I still have to decide which of the two options I have in mind is better, so stay tuned for a follow-up post detailing my thoughts.</p> <p>Fortunately, because there is no VCS change with this move, the move should be pretty much transparent (<a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/2012/02/switching-projects-to-git.html">unlike the move years ago out of Monotone</a>).  The biggest downside may be moving the issue tracker, and that's something I'm just starting to think about.</p> <p>Stay tuned and consider the current GitHub repositories an experiment.</p>
