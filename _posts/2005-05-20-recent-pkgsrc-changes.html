<p>Eww, it has been a very long while since I wrote the previous post, and even more since I did any serious changes in <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>. Real life tasks get in the middle and take too much time (fortunately, this stressful period is about to end). However, during the last few days, I've been able to work a bit on pkgsrc, so I'd like to comment the changes I've done.</p>  <p>First of all, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> has been brought up to 2.10.1, the latest stable release in the 2.10 branch. It should fix many bugs â€” specially one that has been bothering me a lot in Epiphany, as it failed to automatically open files after their download. Note this has been possible, mainly, due to all the updates Matthias Drochner has done; otherwise, I wouldn't have had the time to do everything at the moment.</p>  <p>Secondly and lastly, I've reworked the <i>ao</i> packages. The base <tt>libao</tt> package is now completely driver-agnostic; in other words, it only installs the core library, with no extra plug-ins. The reasons? On the one hand, simplification of the package's code; on the other hand, less chances for it to break on foreign systems (think about the old ugly hacks to handle the PLIST). Of course, to compensate the change, I've added three new packages: <tt>libao-macosx</tt>, <tt>libao-oss</tt> and <tt>libao-sun</tt>, which provide the correct platform-specific driver on the systems where they are allowed to be installed.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
