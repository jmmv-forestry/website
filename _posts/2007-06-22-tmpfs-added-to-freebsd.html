A bit more than a year ago, I reported that <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/04/tmpfs-on-freebsd.html">tmpfs was being ported to FreeBSD</a> from NetBSD (remember that tmpfs was my Google SoC 2005 project and was integrated into NetBSD soon after the program ended).  And Juan Romero Pardines has just brought to my attention that tmpfs is already part of FreeBSD-current!  This is really cool :-)<br /><br />The code was imported to FreeBSD-current on the 16th as seen in the <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/cvs-src/2007-June/079922.html">commit mail</a>, so I suppose it will be part of the next major version (7.0).  I have to thank Rohit Jalan, Howard Su and Glen Leeder for their efforts in this area.<br /><br />Some more details are given in their <a href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/TMPFS">TMPFS wiki page</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit (June 23)</span>: Mentioned where tmpfs is being ported from!
