I just realized that today makes two months since I left my home in Barcelona and headed first to Italy and then to NYC. This means I only have two more months and a week to stay at Google. Ew, time flies so fast...<div><br /></div><div>But so far, things are going great. They could certainly be a little bit better, but not by much!</div><div><br /></div><div>Today, two friends from Spain just left my apartment. They had been here for 10 days doing tourism around the city and visiting lots of stuff. I wish I could also take some vacations like that.</div><div><br /></div><div>And tomorrow it's time for another race: <a href="http://cms.komen.org/komen/NewsEvents/RacefortheCure/index.htm">Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure</a>. It is just 5Km in Central Park, so it will be pretty easy but, hopefully, fun enough. The only "problem" is that it is at 9am, and today is Saturday... so I need to hang go out (with some restrictions)!</div>
