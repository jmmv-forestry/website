I just finished reading the third book in a row from Joel Spolsky, titled Joel on Software. Before this one, I read More Joel on Software and The Best Software Writing 1, all in a bit over a month. Note: I hadn't read any book cover-to-cover for a loooong while. Very interesting and entertaining books; highly recommended.<div><br /></div><div>Oh, and his writing style is really enjoyable. We, crappy blog writers, can learn a lot from him!</div>
