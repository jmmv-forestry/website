<p>Despite I don't like doing premature announcements of my projects, I've been kind of forced to do it for <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/projects/tmpfs/">tmpfs</a>. The reason is that SoC's deadline is really close now and people should have a chance to test it. Not to mention that the code won't suffer any serious improvements in the subsequent days, so delaying the announcement is not worth it either.</p>  <p>You can read the announcement in <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2005/08/26/0006.html">my mail to the tech-kern@ mailing list</a>, which also includes a step-by-step guide to test tmpfs.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
