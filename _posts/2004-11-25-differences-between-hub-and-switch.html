<p>A friend of mine asked me yesterday which are the differences between a hub and a switch. After giving her a quick explanation, I realized that I'd write something better and leave it here for anyone else interested. However, a detailed explanation could need a lot of background theory, so these are just the basic ideas that differentiate these network devices.</p>  <p>First of all: <a href="http://www.ieee802.org/3/">Ethernet</a>'s logical topology is a <i>bus</i>: a single cable carries all data in all directions, which reach all equipments connected to it. Just think about a network using 10Base2 or 10Base5 (coaxial cable) and you'll quickly understand this point.</p>  <p>Now suppose you collapse all the bus (the cable that reaches all computers) in a little box and then connect this little box to each computer using another cable. This box is basically a <i>hub</i>, a level 1 device in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI model</a>.  Note that the physical topology of the network has become a <i>star</i> (all cables go to a central point), but logically, it's still a bus (this last part is important, because Ethernet is always a bus).</p>  <p>More specifically, a hub processes data bit by bit.  Whenever a bit arrives through a port, it's automatically replicated to <i>all</i> others. Aside replication, it also regenerates and amplifies the transmitted signal. But keep in mind that it doesn't process any of the data that travels through it (it's a level 1 device).</p>  <p>On the other hand, a switch is more complex. It's quite similar to a hub in its physical functionality, though a switch isolates connections between hosts: frames sent through a port are <i>only</i> replicated to the port that contains the target computer, <i>not all</i> ports. To do this, the switch stores the received frame into memory, gets its target MAC address, finds a match in its MAC-to-port translation table and transmits the frame to that port. Therefore, this is a level 2 device.</p>  <p>Because the switch handles level 2 frames (not raw bits), it can do much more than just replicate data. For example, it can avoid the replication of collisions and errors: the former is always present, but the later is only found in <i>store and forward</i> switches (not <i>cut-through</i>).</p>  <p>However, a good (and very expensive) switch can do much more than this; it can apply security policies to ports, replicate configurations to other switches, manage virtual LANs, etc.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
