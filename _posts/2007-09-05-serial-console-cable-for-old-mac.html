I'm currently working on the NetBSD/mac68k kernel to migrate it from the old rcons framebuffer driver to a more modern one that supports colors, virtual terminals, custom fonts and all other assorted goodies that come with wscons.  Unfortunately, I've found a very mysterious system hang-up with my code that I cannot easily debug from the machine itself because the console does not work at all.  Hence, I needed to have a serial console for this machine, a Performa 630.<br /><br />The problem is that old Macintoshes use a DIN-8 connector for their serial line, as opposed to the DE-9 (or DE-25) used in PCs.  Fortunately it is possible to connect the two by properly wiring a conversion cable, and that's what I've done today.  My first attempt failed because I built a DTE-DCE cable (used to connect to modems and other communications equipment), but in the end I got it, which resulted in a "null-modem" cable to connect the two machines.<br /><br />Here is the scheme I used:<br /><br /><table align="center" border="1"><thead><tr><td><b>DIN-8 (DTE)</b></td><td><b>DC-9 (DCE)</b></td><td><b>DC-9 (DTE)</b></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>N/C</td><td>N/C</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>N/C</td><td>N/C</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr></tbody></table><br />N/C stands for "Not connected".  Use at your own risk.
