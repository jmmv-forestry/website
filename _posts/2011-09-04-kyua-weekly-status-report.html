Slow week.&nbsp; We had some team-related events at work and I have friends over from Dublin, so it has been hard to find some time to do work on Kyua.&nbsp; Regardless, here comes the weekly report: <br /><ul><li>Split utils::lua into its own package, per some user's request.&nbsp; I'm still setting up the separate project and have to do lots of cleanup on the code, so nothing is available yet.</li><li>Started experimenting on the long promised "tests results database".&nbsp; So far, I have started writing a small utils::sqlite3 C++, RAII-based wrapper for SQLite 3 and a SQL schema for the database.&nbsp; My rusty SQL skills don't help :-P</li></ul>However, all this work is local so there have been no commits to the repository this week; sorry!
