<a href="http://www.ddj.com/">Dr. Dobb's Journal</a> is running a set of mini-articles promoting Summer of Code projects.  Next month's issue includes the <a href="http://www.ddj.com/documents/s=9985/ddj0603g/0603g.html">tmpfs' introductory article</a>, written by me and William Studenmund, the project's mentor.<br /><br />Looks like you have to register to access the full article; previous issues used to have them publically available.  Personally, I'm going to wait for the printed version :-)
