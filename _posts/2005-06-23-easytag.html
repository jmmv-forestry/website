<p>A few days ago, I finally decided to sort all my MP3s. I started erasing lots of cruft that I never listen to and then renamed some files I had with weird names. I ended up with this layout: <i>Artist/Album year - Album name/Song number - Song name.mp3</i>.</p>  <p>When finished, I was exposed to the task of setting up the ID3 tags for all of them, something I did in the past using custom shell scripts together the <a href="http://id3v2.sourceforge.net/">id3v2</a> utility.  However, this was a very error prone task, mainly due to string quoting in the shell.</p>  <p>So I decided to give a try to the <a href="http://easytag.sourceforge.net/">EasyTAG</a> utility. Man... what a wonderful tool! Just needed a few minutes to discover how it worked, and some minutes later, I had all my songs with correct ID3 tags in them. Certainly, give it a try.</p>  <p>Hmm, now it is a pleasure to use <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/rhythmbox/">Rhythmbox</a>, as all the songs appear correctly classified.  Unfortunately, as it doesn't have an equalizer, I'll stick to <a href="http://www.sosdg.org/%7Elarne/w/BMP_Homepage">Beep Media Player</a>.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
