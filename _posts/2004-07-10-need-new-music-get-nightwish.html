<p>So, you are bored of always listening to the same music in your collection. Maybe it's time to get some new discs. If that's what you are thinking, give a try to <a href="http://www.nightwish.com/">Nightwish</a>, a Finnish band.  You won't regret about this choice ;)  Their style is often described as <i>gothic metal</i>, although I've also seen them classified as <i>opera metal</i>.  Never mind, just listen to them and then make your own conclusions.</p>  <p>Their last album, <i>Once</i> (published this year), is really cool, although many people says that it "sounds different" than previous discs. It's possible that you have listened to the <i>Nemo</i> song in the radio (it's the only song I've listened there so far), which is a bit commercial. If in doubt, other very good albums are <i>Century Child</i> (2002) and <i>Oceanborn</i> (1998); all of this IMHO, of course.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
