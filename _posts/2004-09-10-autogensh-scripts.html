<p>The GNU Build System works by generating scripts that have to be later distributed in your distribution file; these include <tt>Makefile.in</tt>s and <tt>configure</tt>, among others.  Many projects that use it are managed by a version control system (such as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/cvs/">CVS</a>), although they don't keep the generated files under revision control (which is a good thing in many scenarios).</p>  <p>When you check out a copy of these sources from the repository, you don't get any of the build scripts you need to build the project on your machine; instead, you have to deal with the task of previously creating them. However, many projects provide a shell script aimed to simplify this task, usually named <tt>autogen.sh</tt>.  This script runs <tt>automake</tt>, <tt>autoconf</tt>, <tt>aclocal</tt> and other utilities in the right order to create the required files.  But this is a very bad idea.  Consider that <tt>aclocal</tt> will be replaced with something else in the future, thus breaking your scripts.</p>  <p>The solution is named <tt>autoreconf</tt>, which comes with GNU Autoconf.  This program deals with the task of running <tt>autoheader</tt>, <tt>aclocal</tt>, <tt>automake</tt>, <tt>autopoint</tt> (known as <tt>gettextize</tt> too) and <tt>libtoolize</tt> where appropiate to remake the GNU Build System files. Furthermore, it only remakes those files that are older than their predecessors, or those that don't exist. Just try it: run <tt>autoreconf -is</tt> on a project and see how the files are automagically created.</p>  <p>But... what if you need to run other tools like <tt>intltoolize</tt>?  Then, in this case, it is still good to provide an <tt>autogen.sh</tt> script.  So all it would do is run <tt>intltoolize</tt> and later run <tt>autoreconf</tt>.</p>  <p>Just remember to not run any of the tools automatically executed by <tt>autoreconf</tt> in your <tt>autogen.sh</tt> script.  Anything else is appropiate.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
