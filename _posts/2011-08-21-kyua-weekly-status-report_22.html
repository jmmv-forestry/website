<br /><ul><li>Implemented the "debug" command. Still very rudimentary, this command allows the user to run a test case without capturing its stdout nor stderr to aid in debugging of failed test cases. In the future, this command will also allow things like keeping the work directory for manual inspection, or spawning a shell or a debugger in the work directory after a test case is executed.</li>
<li>Many build fixes under different platforms in preparation for a 0.2 release. In particular, Kyua now builds under Ubuntu 10.04.1 LTS but some tests fail.</li>
<li>Had to disable the execution of the bootstrap test suite within Kyua because it stalls in systems where the default shell is not bash. &nbsp;I presume this is a bug in GNU Autotest, so I <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-autoconf/2011-08/msg00009.html">filed a report</a>.</li>
