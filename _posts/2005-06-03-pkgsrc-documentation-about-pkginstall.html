<p>Two days ago I started touching the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/faq.html">FAQ</a> chapter in the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/">pkgsrc's Guide</a> and I literally opened a can of worms.  The thing is that I started to rewrite the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/faq.html#faq.conf">question about configuration files placement</a> (because most of the answer was just internal details of pkgsrc) and ended up writing a whole <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/pkgsrc/pkginstall.html">new chapter about the pkginstall framework</a>.  Hope it's an interesting read for you ;)</p>  <p>Now... I'm afraid to touch anything else, as I know what will happen â€” more heavy rewrites (I like writing). It's not that I don't want to do it, but I must do some other things first...</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
