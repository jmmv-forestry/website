<p>Yesterday, I saw a screenshot of a developer's box.  His prompt was composed of two characters only: a colon and a semicolon (<tt>:;</tt>). This looks wired, doesn't it? Yes, it does, but there is a rationale behind it: using this prompt, you can copy and paste complete lines from a terminal into another one and they will just work. Why? Because those characters are ignored by the shell (the colon returns success and the semicolon starts another command).</p>  <p>Oh yes, this prompt does not provide useful information, but that's a matter of preference.  E.g., I used a simple <tt>$</tt> prompt for a long while, so <tt>:;</tt> is not any worse than it.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
