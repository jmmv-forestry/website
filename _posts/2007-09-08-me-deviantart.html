I have been a <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/">deviantART</a> member for a bit more than three years already &mdash; wow, time passes fast... too fast &mdash;, but I never submitted any stuff I was really proud of.  In fact, I have just removed the three deviations I had in my account.<br /><br />Now that I own a decent digital camera, I think I'll start posting some of the photos I like most in that place after retouching them a bit.  I don't know if I'll keep up with this, but I'm optimist right now ;-)  Feel free to dive into <a href="http://jmmv.deviantart.com/">my member page</a> and see the two photos I posted!<br /><br />"Why not Flickr?", I hear.  At the moment I think I won't be posting lots of photos nor personal ones; that is, not full photo rolls and not photos of me nor any other person I know.  Hence deviantART seems a better place to share my "selected" stuff.
