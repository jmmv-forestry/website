A friend of mine recently started a blog called <a href="http://dirtandthecity.blogspot.com/">Dirt and the City</a> and, because he has invited me to contribute to it, I feel like posting a reference here ;-)<br /><br />Dirt and the City is a blog that intends to show you the "ugly" (literally) side of NYC. The blog is named after a famous TV show filmed in this same city; I haven't watched the show myself, but I bet that there is no dirt to be seen in it. If you are wondering what the city really looks like, this blog is your place.<br /><br />But, before visiting the blog, be sure to take it as it is meant to be: just a fun collection of photos! If you ever want to visit NYC, don't let the contents of the blog change your plans. You will definitely enjoy your visit regardless.<br /><br />Without further ado, and just in case you missed the link above, <a href="http://dirtandthecity.blogspot.com/">click here to visit Dirt and the City</a>.
