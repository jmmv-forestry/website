<p>I've to enrol myself in the university again - 5th semester - this Friday. The first problem is to choose the subjects I want to do; there are a lot of different subjects to choose from. But when chosen, the big problem is to schedule them so that they don't overlap in the timetable.</p>  <p>For those who have the same problem, well... only if you are studying at the <a href="http://www.fib.upc.es/">FIB faculty</a>... there is a program, <a href="http://personal.redestb.es/hcortes/">Compatibilitzador</a>, that can do the work for you. You only need to introduce which hours are addressed to each subject, and all the groups they are divided into. After this, you simply ask the program to calculate all possible timetables that have no overlaping subjects. And that's it!</p>  <p>If you know Catalan, you can use it for your enrolling too, but it'll be a bit more difficult. You'll have to add all the information manually; otherwise, it can read HTML files produced by LCFIB pages.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
