<p>Eight months ago, <a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/2015/05/hello-medium.html">I decided to try Medium</a> as the platform on which to post my essays. Over this time I have published a handful of posts in there—8, to be precise, which is... a very shy number—but the results have been quite satisfactory: the WYSIWYG composer is excellent, the analytics tools are simple but to the point, the looks are great, and the community is nice (though I haven't been able to tap into it just yet).</p> <p>But where have things failed?</p> <p>You will have to <b>read more on this topic</b> on a post appropriately titled <a href="http://julio.meroh.net/blog/2016/01/28/medium-experiment-wrapup.html">The Medium experiment wrap-up</a> that I have published on the shiny-new <a href="http://julio.meroh.net/blog/">blog section</a> of my personal homepage.  But, to sum things up:</p> <blockquote><i>Medium has failed as the place where I want to post my articles first though it remains a great secondary place for content redistribution and promotion</i>.</blockquote> <p>On that site, you can also find externalized copies of the Medium posts I have written so far as well as a commenting system that you may find less intimidating (if only because it doesn't force you to create an account).  Yes, this custom website is my new experiment for publication, and I still have yet to decide if it will end up finally replacing The Julipedia. Stay tuned.</p>
