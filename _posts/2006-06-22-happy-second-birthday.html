Today makes the second year since this blog <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2004/06/welcome-to-my-new-journal.html">was born</a>; its birth happened in the middle of final exams, just as the same period I'm in now.  As you may remember, it was firstly hosted on <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">Livejournal</a> but was later migrated to <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> on <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/10/blog-migrated-to-blogger-welcome.html">October 22nd, 2005</a>.  During the switch, it was renamed from "jmmv's weblog" to "The Julipedia".<br /><br />This makes the 272nd post which gives an average of 0.37 posts a day.  My initial intention was to reach a constant rate of a post per day, but I have been unable to keep up with that goal.  I have so much other things to do... but now that the semester is almost over, I hope to be able to post more often.<br /><br />During the whole life time of this blog, there was a single month without posts (August 2004) because I was on holidays.  According to the statistics, there are an average of 70 unique visits per day with some random days going over 120.  Overall, a total of almost 15,400 unique visits since the migration to Blogger.  I think it's in quite good health.<br /><br />Happy birthday and thank you all for reading :-)
