The Google Summer of Code 2009 application deadline for students is tomorrow and NetBSD has got very few applications so far. If you have the interest in working on a cool operating system project, where almost any project idea can fit, take the time to read <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/soc-projects.html">our proposals</a> and apply!  New, original ideas not listed there will also be considered.<br /><br />It'd be a pity if the number of assigned slots to NetBSD was small due to the low number of applications!  We did much better past year.<br /><br />Note that there are a couple of <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/">ATF</a>-related proposals in there. Help will be certainly welcome (by me ;-) in those areas!
