<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">The GNOME Project</a> has just released the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.6/">2.6.2 version</a> of its desktop environment, probably the last release of the 2.6 stable branch.  The <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2004-June/msg00067.html">official announcement</a> provides more information, including a list of changes since the previous version.  <p>Furthermore, I've just updated all the GNOME packages in <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> to their respective versions in this new release.  That is, you can easily install GNOME 2.6.2 with the simple <code>cd pkgsrc/meta-pkgs/gnome &&amp; make install</code> command... and on multiple platforms!  This may be a good reason to try this excellent package system today ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
