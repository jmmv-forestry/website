Some days ago I updated my system to the latest version of Mac OS X Tiger, 10.4.10.  It hasn't been until today that I realized that there is a new cool preferences panel called <i>Processor</i>:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RoeUfAAM38I/AAAAAAAAABE/-ueppW9G5P4/s1600-h/systemprefs.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RoeUfAAM38I/AAAAAAAAABE/-ueppW9G5P4/s400/systemprefs.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5082193964808593346" border="0" /></a>It looks like this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RoeUfAAM37I/AAAAAAAAAA8/8SyoqC4G84k/s1600-h/procsprefpane.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RoeUfAAM37I/AAAAAAAAAA8/8SyoqC4G84k/s400/procsprefpane.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5082193964808593330" border="0" /></a>As you can see, it gives information about each processor in the machine and also lets you disable any processor you want.<br /><br />There is also another "hidden" window, accessible from the menu bar control after you have enabled it.  It is called the <i>Processor palette</i> and looks like this:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RoeUewAM36I/AAAAAAAAAA0/VPiLWElqQFQ/s1600-h/procspalette.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xLbGV919cEE/RoeUewAM36I/AAAAAAAAAA0/VPiLWElqQFQ/s400/procspalette.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5082193960513626018" border="0" /></a>I already monitor the processor activity by using the <i>Activity Monitor</i>'s dock icon, which is much more compact, but this one is nice :-)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Edit (16:22)</span>: Rui Paulo writes in a comment that this is available if you install Xcode.  It turns out I have had Xcode installed for ages, but my installation did not contain the CHUD tools.  I recently added them to the system, which must be the reason behind this new item in the system preferences.  So... this is not related to the 10.4.10 update I mentioned at first.
