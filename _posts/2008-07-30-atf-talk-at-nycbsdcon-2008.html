<a href="http://www.nycbsdcon.org/2008/">NYCBSDCon 2008</a> will take place in New York City on October 11th and 12th.  Given that I am already in NYC and will still be by that time, I submitted a presentation proposal about <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/atf/">ATF</a>.  I have just been notified that my proposal has been accepted and, therefore, I will be giving a talk on ATF itself and how it relates to <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a> on one of those two days.  The conference program and schedule have not been published yet, though, so keep tuned.  Hope to see you there! :)
