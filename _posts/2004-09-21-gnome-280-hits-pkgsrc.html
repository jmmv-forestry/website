<p>After more than two weeks of work, I've been able to commit to the <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> tree all the required changes to bring the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> Desktop to its 2.8.0 version.</p>  <p>The update has resulted in 73 new entries added to the <tt>doc/CHANGES</tt> file; of these, 2 are new packages, 70 are package updates and 1 is a removal of a meta package.  Quite a bit, eh? ;-)</p>  <p>Unfortunately, not all the official components that form the GNOME Desktop are in pkgsrc yet; these include gnome-nettool, gnome-system-tools, gnome-volume-manager, gnomemeeting, vino, ximian-connector and evolution-webcal. This is because I have had not enough time to work on them, and I expect they'll carry multiple portability issues. If you want to help, there's always <a href="http://pkgsrc-wip.sourceforge.net/">pkgsrc-wip</a> where you can add any of these missing packages!</p>  <p>Now, to install this new and shining GNOME release, just get into <tt>pkgsrc/meta-pkgsrc/gnome</tt>, type <tt>make install</tt> and you're done!  Oh, and in case you don't know, this is not restricted to NetBSD; you can use pkgsrc even under Linux!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
