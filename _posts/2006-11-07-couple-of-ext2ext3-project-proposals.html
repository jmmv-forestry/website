I've just added a couple of <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html">project proposals</a> related to improving Ext2/Ext3 file system support in the NetBSD Operating System.  These are:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html#ext3fs">Implement Ext3 file system support</a></li><li><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/contrib/projects.html#bootxx_ext2fs">Improve support for Ext2 root filesystem</a></li></ul>If you are interested in getting into file system development &mdash; a very interesting research area, believe me! ;-) &mdash; this is probably a safe bet.  These two projects are not very complex but can quickly benefit NetBSD for different reasons (not only better Linux compatibility).  Check out their descriptions for more details!
