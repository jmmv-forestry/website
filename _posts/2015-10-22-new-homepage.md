Back in May, I wanted to play a little bit with [Twitter
Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and the result of those experiments was
that I set up a personal site on this same URL.  The site served me well for
these months, but I wanted to see it grow to better represent my presence on the
Internet.  To that end, I have now been playing with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a static content management system natively
supported by GitHub Pages, and came up with the site you are own now, which went
live yesterday.

As part of the new site, I am also now opening a [news section](/blog/).  I am
reluctant to call it a blog because [I already have a blog and I now write on
Medium](/writing/)... but I guess that's what this page is.  My intent for this
section is to publish short blurbs about anything I do, even if it is just a
link to the "authoritative" place.  We'll see how that goes.  Writing directly
in Markdown is actually quite nice, and the support for code snippets is very
welcome based on the kinds of articles I typically write.

Enjoy the site and don't forget to subscribe by clicking the link
below---you can't predict if first-class content will *only* show up here!
