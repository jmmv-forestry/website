<p>During the past summer, I started writing an article which details a set of serious problems I usually find when packaging third party utilities. These problems are very annoying, but usually not difficult to fix. They are generally caused because the original software authors are not packagers in most cases, so they are not aware of the things described here. Summarizing: the article analyzes these issues and gives some advice to solve them, in the aim that software developers make easier to package applications.</p>  <p>Why it took so long to get published? Well, I forgot about it until January, when I took it again. At that time, I finished some pending sections, polished some details and, at last, prepared it for its release. Finally, yesterday's evening, it went live on <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp.com</a> (this is my first contribution to the site).  You can read more in the article itself, <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/03/31/packaging.html">Making packager-friendlier software (part 1)</a>.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
