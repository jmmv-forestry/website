You probably know it by now: <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> unleashed its first Intel-based computers yesterday during Steve Jobs' keynote.  The PowerBook has been replaced by a completely new model, named <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a>.  It features a Yonah dual core processor plus a lot of other hardware updates and additions (some removals, too!); it won't be ready until February, but can be already ordered.  As regards desktop machines, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a> has been updated; contrary to the laptop, this machine has suffered "less" updates, which include the processor (also dual-core) and the graphics card.  Otherwise, it's similar to the PPC model; externally, both seem to be the same.<br /><br />I've been looking forward to this announcement for a while &mdash this is why I'm posting it here.  I had expected (as many other people) that the first models to be converted could be the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibook/">iBook</a>s.  Frankly, I'm glad they didn't do it, because I won't feel bad for having bougth this G4 just a month and a half ago.  Don't get me wrong; it's working great ;-)<br /><br />Other news include the update of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> to 10.4.4 (which I'm already running :-) and the release of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife'06</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork'06</a>.<br /><br />I hope that <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a> gets ported to these new machines and that it works as well as the <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/ports/i386/">i386</a> port.  If that's the case, I'll seriously consider a Mac as my next desktop machine (which is still some years away... and who knows what will happen in this time frame).<br /><br /><b>Edit (17:07)</b>: I'm now wondering why the hell on earth many people seems to assume that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows</a> will run on these machines...  All they have done is change the microprocessor (OK, plus other things), but this does not mean it becomes an IBM-compatible system &mdash; just consider Amiga-based and Mac-based 68k systems.  I'm sure somebody will get it working, but it hasn't to be easy.<br /><br /><b>Edit (20:14, 12th January)</b>: I stand corrected.  These Intel-based machines come with regular hardware as found on PC systems; i.e., they run standard Intel microprocessors and chipsets.  The major difference is that they use <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/efi/">EFI</a> (the Extensible Firmware Interface) instead of the obsolete BIOS.  Looks like Windows Vista will run on them directly (and Apple won't forbid it :-).  As regards NetBSD, support for EFI will be needed as well as (possibly) some new drivers.
