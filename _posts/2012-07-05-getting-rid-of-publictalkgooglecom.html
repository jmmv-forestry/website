If you use a native IM client to connect to Google Talk and also have a Google+ account, you probably have noticed by now that your contacts list is polluted by tons of addresses of the form <tt>annoyinghash@public.talk.google.com</tt>. Attempting to talk to these people from the native IM client does not work (maybe it does in some specific situations? I don't know.), so these contacts only add noise and annoyance.<br /><div><br /></div><div>It turns out that these "spurious" contacts are the people that you have in your Google+ circles, and I suppose allows such people to talk to you when you are logged into Google+. Me, I don't necessarily want to allow all of these people in my chat list.<br /><br />After a bit of searching around, I have found that it is possible to remove them completely from your Google Talk list. Because all the answers I could find were incomplete and/or vague replies to forum questions, I'm writing the procedure down here for posterity.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">Do as follows:</span></div><div><ol><li>Log into your Google+ account.</li><li>Sign into the builtin chat client on the right-hand side panel.</li><li>Open the drop-down menu next to your name within the chat client and select <tt>Privacy settings</tt>.</li><li>In the <tt>Choose who can chat with you</tt> option, select <tt>Custom</tt>.</li><li>Unselect all the circle names in the checkboxes that appear.</li><li>Click save.</li><li>Witness all those useless contacts vanish from your IM clients! (Both native and web based.)</li></ol></div>
