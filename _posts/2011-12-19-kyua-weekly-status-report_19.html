Unfortunately, not much activity this week due to travel reasons. Anyway, some work went in:<br /><br /><ul><li>Preliminary code to generate HTML reports from <tt>kyua report</tt>. This is easy peasy but boring. The current code was written as a proof of concept and is awful, hence why it was not committed. I'm now working in cleaning it up.</li><li>Backported test program and test case timestamping into ATF based on a patch from Paul Goyette. This is a very useful feature to have, and it will have to be added to Kyua later. (It has always been planned to be added, but have not had the time yet.)</li></ul>
