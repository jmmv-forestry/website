<p>11 years. Next month will mark 11 years since the creation of The Julipedia, the blog you are in now and the blog that got me started into this writing journey. 11 years that have brought 690 posts (yeah, yeah, not that many for such a long time).</p> <p>And after all this time, it finally hit me: personal blogs have lost their original appeal. It is time for a change. But a changeâ€¦ to what?</p> <p><i>Is Medium the answer?</i></p> <p>I don't know, but to see what I think on this topic, follow onto my very first post appropriately titled <a href="https://medium.com/@jmmv/hello-medium-2c73c580c4ca">Hello, Medium!</a> and let me know what you think. I'll keep experimenting there, so make sure to <a href="https://medium.com/@jmmv">follow my @jmmv profile</a> to not miss a beat.</p> <script async src="https://static.medium.com/embed.js"></script><a class="m-profile" href="https://medium.com/@jmmv">Julio Merino</a>
