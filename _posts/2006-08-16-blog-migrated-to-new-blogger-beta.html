<a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a> announced yesterday multiple improvements to their service.  These are still in beta &mdash; as almost all other <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> stuff, you know ;-) &mdash; and are being offered to existing users progressively.  To my surprise, the option to migrate was available on my dashboard today so I applied for it; I was very interested in the post labelling feature.<br /><br />The migration process has been flawless and trivial.  After the change nothing seemed to have changed except for some minor nits in the UI.  I looked around for the labels feature but discovered that it is only available once you migrate to the new "layouts system", an easier way to desing your blog's look.<br /><br />The switch to layouts scared me a bit because I was afraid of not being able to integrate the <a href="http://www.statcounter.com/">Statcounter</a> code back again.  But after verifying that the change was reversible, I tried it.  I can confirm that the new customization page is much, much easier to use than before, although still too limited (direct HTML editing is not available yet).  Oh, and I seized the oportunity to switch to a slightly different theme (yes, it was available before).<br /><br />Aside from that there are some new nice features such as RSS feeds (weren't they there before?), a better archive navigation (see the right bar), integration with Google accounts and many other things I'm surely missing.<br /><br />Summarizing: It has taken a long while for the Google people to upgrade Blogger's service, but the wait has been worth it.  Now more than ever, I don't regret <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/10/blog-migrated-to-blogger-welcome.html">migrating from Livejournal</a> to this site almost a year ago.
