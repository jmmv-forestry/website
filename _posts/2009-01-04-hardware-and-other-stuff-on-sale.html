I need to get rid of lots of stuff that I haven't used for a long time and that are only taking space here.  Most of them will go to the trash but, if you are interested, let me know and make an offer for them!  Yes, "for free" is valid on some items ;)  Those items that have a price is the ones that I think are most valuable and I will keep them unless someone wants to buy them.<br /><br />Keep in mind that all this stuff is in Barcelona, Spain, and that shipping is not too practical for me.  Still, if you are very interested in some item, we can probably sort it out.<br /><br />With all that said, <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/~jmmv/sale.html/">check the list out</a>.  I may keep updating it during the following days.<br /><br />PS: How can I have accumulated so much crap?...
