<p>Hi readers! I'm back from my vacations. Well... in fact I came back a week ago but haven't had a chance to write something for the blog.</p>  <p>So, what are my current projects?  First of all, I've been updating all the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> packages in <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> to the latest published development version, 2.7.92, in preparation for the shortcoming 2.8. pkgsrc enters a code freeze tomorrow, in preparation for the new 2004Q3 stable branch; this will last for two weeks, during which I'll be finishing the update and getting ready to do the mega-commit when the freeze is over.</p>  <p>I've been also working on a new program that simplifies the process of updating file hierarchies managed by a version control system, such as CVS or Subversion. With a very simple command, you will be able to update all predefined directories transparently, and generate pretty reports to be mailed to you or put on a webserver. It's designed to be easily run from cron(8) and to be run from sudo(1), so that you can let your users update system-wide trees but without letting them direct access. The code still needs several improvements, but it might well be released as a 0.1 version.</p>  <p>At last, I have to finish two small articles and publish them somewhere; one is about the GNU Build System and the other about making software package-friendly.</p>  <p>Will keep you informed about any progress ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
