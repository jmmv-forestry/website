I recently installed NetBSD-current (4.99.12 at the time I did this) inside Parallels Desktop for Mac.  Everything went fine except for the configuration of the XFree86 shipped with the base system: I was unable to get high resolutions to work (over 1024x768 if I recall correctly), and I wanted to configure a full-screen desktop.  In my specific case, this is 1440x900, the MacBook Pro's native resolution.<br /><br />It turns out I had to manually add a mode line to the XF86Config file to get that resolution detected.  I bet recent X.Org versions do not need this as, e.g. Fedora Core 6 works fine without manual fiddling.<br /><br />Writing mode lines is not fun, but fortunately I came across an automated generator.  In fact, this seems to be just a web-based <a href="http://www.sh.nu/nvidia/gtf.php">frontend to the gtf tool</a> provided by NVIDIA.  So I entered the appropriate details (x = 1440, y = 900, refresh = 60), hit the <i>Generate modeline</i> button and got:<br /><br /><tt># 1440x900 @ 60.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 55.92 kHz; pclk: 106.47 MHz<br /><br />Modeline "1440x900_60.00"  106.47  1440 1520 1672 1904  900 901 904 932  -HSync +Vsync</tt><br /><br />After that I had to make the <tt>HorizSync</tt> and <tt>VertRefresh</tt> values in my configuration file a bit wider to fulfill this mode's request and everything worked fine.  Be extremely careful if you mess with synchronization values though; incorrect ones can physically damage a monitor, although I <i>think</i> this is not a problem for LCDs.
