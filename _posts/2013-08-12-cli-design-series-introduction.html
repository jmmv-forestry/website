<p>Ready for a new series?</p> <p>Having just gone over a bunch of items regarding <a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/2013/08/readability-series-wrap-up.html">code readability</a>, it is time to shift gears and get into the topic of the design of Command Line Interfaces (or CLIs for short).</p> <p>The main focus of this series will be to cover best practices involved in creating applications whose interface is command-line oriented.  Among other things, I will detail how the CLI should accept optional and required arguments, how a tool should expose more than one action and how interactive help should be handled.</p> <p>Please note that console applications that use "drawing" libraries like <tt>curses</tt> are out of scope in these series: these applications follow to some extent the same principles as GUI-based applications, with the only difference being that their rendering happens in text mode.  Therefore, the guidelines for their design are completely different and I don't have enough experience to comment on them.</p> <p>And now, a little disclaimer: I am well aware that the articles on this topic can be controversial: there are several different ways to design a CLI just as there are a million ways to design a GUI or a web page.  So... just keep in mind that what I will be describing here are my own recollection of thoughts after having had to deal with tons of command line utilities and being annoyed by their inconsistencies and surprising behaviors &mdash; all caused by each tool implementing its own style for no real reason.</p> <p>Hope that you agree, at least, on a few points ;-)</p>
