At last, my new apartment is... OMG confirmed!  Will be moving on August 1st and will stay there for four months. The location is good because it is just one block away from Google and is also very close to lots and lots of pubs and restaurants.<div><br /></div><div>Haven't done much work today though.  I spent all the morning applying for a SSN number, and then I spent part of the evening opening a bank account and getting used to its online services.</div><div><br /></div><div>Hope that tomorrow will be more productive.</div>
