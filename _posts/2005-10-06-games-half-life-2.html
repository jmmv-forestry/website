<a href="http://www.half-life2.com/">Half-Life 2</a>'s Game Of The Year edition was published past Friday. I finally bought it (have been waiting for this since I threw away my illegal copy several months ago); this edition is cheaper than the original game and comes with some goodies. <p>And just a few minutes ago, I completed it :-) (had started with my old saved game, which was almost at the end). All I can say is that the game is really stunning. If you like FPSs, this is The One.</p>  <p>There is a lot of variety in the game, as opposed to <a href="http://www.doom3.com/">Doom 3</a>, which I find quite repetitive. Each chapter has its own style and suits the story well. There are also multiple weapons and, as you know, the physics are really well done.</p>  <p>Now, it's time to play it again at a higher difficulty level. I think I'll wait until I renew my video card, though. And also, time to play Half-Life: Source, no matter I've already finished the first game three times :-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
