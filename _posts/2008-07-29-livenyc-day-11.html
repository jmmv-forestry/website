One more day and nothing special to say. Just that I tried to open a bank account and they require <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">two</span> different IDs, which I was not carrying. Any idea about why is that?<div><br /></div><div>Let's hope I can open the account tomorrow... but even then, the transfer of the money I have in Spain to this account will not happen on the same day, so I'm not sure about how I'll deal with the housing payment...</div><div><br /></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Edit (23:10)</span>: Oh, and just finished watching Dexter Season 1. Highly recommended!<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span></div>
