About a week ago, my desktop machine was driving me crazy because I couldn't comfortably work on anything other than <a href="http://www.NetBSD.org/">NetBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> themselves.  With "other work" I'm referring to Boost.Process and, most importantly, university assignments.  Given my painless experience with the iBook G4 laptop I've had for <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2005/11/got-new-laptop-ibook-12.html">around a year</a>, I was decided to replace the desktop machine with a Mac &mdash; most likely a brand-new iMac 20" &mdash; to run <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a> on top of it exclusively &mdash; OK, OK, alongside Windows XP to satisfy the eventual willingness to play some games.<br /><br />Before making a final decision, I installed <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> 6.06 LTS a few days ago on the desktop machine &mdash; an Athlon XP 2600+ with 1 GB of RAM, a couple of hard disks (80 and 120 GBs) and a GeForce 6600GT &mdash; so that I could focus on my tasks in the meantime.  I had already used Ubuntu it in the past but not as my primary system, and I must confess it has impressed me a lot.  Given this, the fact that my machine can't be considered old yet, that I already own a 20" screen and, of course, the price, I'm reconsidering the decision to buy the iMac.<br /><br />Canonical is doing a good job at developing a desktop operating system that <i>just works</i> for most, if not all, of the common end-user needs; that should be the definition of a desktop OS, shouldn't it?  Sure, they are using components available everywhere else (modulo some custom changes) such as Debian GNU/Linux, the GNOME Desktop and an assorted set of related utilities. This, alongside the huge package repositories of Debian, provides a system with a lot of ready-to-install software that is useful to lots of people.  Even more, the system itself requires few maintenance as most of it is completely automated.<br /><br />That's enough for the introduction.  I would like now to compare Mac OS X Tiger against Ubuntu 6.06 LTS to see how they stack up to each other.  Given that there are several aspects I want to cover in detail, I'll be unleashing them in the following days instead of posting them all in a single message; that'll hopefully be easier to digest.  Just keep in mind that I'm speaking based on my experiences so that some comments may be subjective.  I also hope that these essays will make me take a final decision of what to do with the machine I currently have! ;-)<br /><br />Stay tuned!
