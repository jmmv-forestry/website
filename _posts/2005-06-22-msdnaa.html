<p>So... <a href="http://www.fib.upc.es/">my faculty</a> became part of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/academic/">MSDNAA program</a> few months ago.  This program is meant to provide students with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>'s software — basically operating systems and development tools — for free. The intention (I guess) is to let we, the students, learn how these software packages work so that we use them in the future in our professional career.</p>  <p>Well, the thing is that, thanks to this, I can finally have a legal copy of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows</a> on my machine, and I also have the opportunity to try programs like <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/vstudio/">Visual Studio .NET 2003</a>.  It feels good; at least I can use them without regretting.</p>  <p>But why do I want Windows, you may ask?  I already outlined it <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmmv/34847.html">two days ago</a>: to try if my programs are portable to Windows using typical compilers (the ones I can get legally, such as the <a href="http://www.borland.com/">Borland</a>'s one or the Microsoft's one).  Oh well, and of course, to play a bit too ;)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
