Since there were no comments after my <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2006/01/multiboot-support-for-review.html">request for review</a> for the patch that makes NetBSD be Multiboot-compliant, I have <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/source-changes/2006/02/03/0020.html">commited it to the tree</a>.  This feature is enabled as a default on i386's <tt>GENERIC</tt> and <tt>GENERIC_LAPTOP</tt> kernels; for others, you need to add <tt>options MULTIBOOT</tt> to their configuration file.<br /><br />Please note that regular GRUB builds will not boot these new kernels properly.  This is because of <a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=15590">a bug in GRUB Legacy</a>.  You either need to install <tt>grub-0.97nb4</tt> from pkgsrc or manually apply <a href="ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/jmmv/grub-fix-addresses.diff">this patch</a> to the GRUB sources.<br /><br />See multiboot(8) for more information.<br /><br /><b>Edit (Feb 6th, 21:06)</b>: Some typos fixed based on comments from Reinhard von der Lippe.  Does anyone remember seeing this happening (the post update) a couple of days ago?  If you use an aggregator, you should have seen an update to the post that looked very similar to this. (More details on the comments.)
