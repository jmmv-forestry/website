Yesterday, we saw how to <a href="http://julipedia.blogspot.com/2007/01/install-mac-os-x-over-multiple-volumes.html">install Mac OS X over multiple volumes</a>, but there is a minor glitch in doing so: all "extra" volumes will appear as different drives in the <i>Finder</i>, which means additional icons on the desktop and its windows' sidebars.  I find these items useless: why should I care about a part of the file system being stored in a different partition? (Note that this has nothing to do with icons for removable media and external drives, a these really are useful.)<br /><br />The removal of the extra volumes from the sidebars is trivial: just right-click (or Control+click) on the drive entry and select the <i>Remove from Sidebar</i> option.<br /><br />But how to deal with the icons on the desktop?  One possibility is to open the <i>Finder</i>'s preferences and tell it to not show entries for hard disks.  The downside is that all direct accesses to the file system will disappear, including those that represent external disks.<br /><br />A slightly better solution is to mark the volume's mount point as hidden, which will effectively make it invisible to the <i>Finder</i>.  To do this you have to set the <i>invisible</i> extended attribute on the folder by using the <tt>SetFile(1)</tt> utility (stored in <tt>/Developer/Tools</tt>, thus included in <i>Xcode</i>).  For example, to hide our example <tt>/Users</tt> mount point:<pre># /Developer/Tools/SetFile -a V /Users</pre>You'll need to relaunch the <i>Finder</i> for the changes to take effect.<br /><br />The above is not perfect, though: the mount point will be hidden from all <i>Finder</i> windows, not only from the desktop.   I don't know if there is any better way to achieve this, but this one does the trick...
