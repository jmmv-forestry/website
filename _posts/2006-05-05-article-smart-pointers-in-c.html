A bit more than a year ago I discovered what smart pointers are, thanks to the <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm">Boost Smart Pointers</a> library.  Since then I can no longer think of a C++ program that handles dynamic memory without them, because it is highly subject to programming mistakes and is hard to write.  (Of course, there are exceptions.)<br /><br />This is why I decided to write the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/05/04/smart-pointers.html">Smart Pointers in C++</a> article which just got published in <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/">ONLamp.com</a>.  It contains an introduction to the idea behind smart pointers and describes those included in the C++ standard library and Boost.  Hope you find it interesting!
