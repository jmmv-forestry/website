<p>I just realized I haven't posted about this before...  A month ago or so, I was invited by the <a href="http://www.partyzipa.com/">Partyzip@</a> organizational team to give a conference about <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>.  For those that don't know it, Partyzip@ is a party held at Monzï¿½n, Spain: it holds several <a href="http://www.partyzipa.com/conferencias.php">technological conferences and workshops</a> as well as <a href="http://www.partyzipa.com/torneos.php">gaming contests</a>.  This is its second year.</p>  <p>My conference will be given on July 10th in the morning. I will give an introduction to the NetBSD operating system covering topics such as the release scheme, project goals, existing technologies, future projects, cross compilation, etc. Of course, I'll also talk about <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a> in detail.  And why not, I can also talk about <a href="http://netbsd-soc.sourceforge.net/">NetBSD-SoC</a>! ;-)</p>  <p>If you are interested to come, note that you must <a href="http://www.partyzipa.com/inscripciones.php">register</a> first.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
