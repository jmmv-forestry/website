<p>I have seen many times people thinking that a signal has better quality if it's in digital form rather than in analog form, yet this is false. When you convert an analog signal to a digital format, you <i>always</i> lose quality because you are converting a continuous signal to a discrete one.  Let's see a little example:</p>  <p>Suppose we want to digitize a 20KHz analog audio signal so that we can store it on disk.  Following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist-Shannon_sampling_theorem">Nyquist theorem</a>, we must take a minimum of 40K samples per second; this guarantees that we can recreate the original signal in its exact form (i.e., maximum quality).</p>  <p>The lost of quality arises at this point: how can we represent each sample without losing precision (assuming, of course, that the sample is accurate)? Samples are measured in a continuous scale, but in order to store them we must round their value up or down to a discrete value we can represent (think about representing a real number, which leads to the same problem). We'd need infinite precision to store each sample in its exact form, which means infinite disk space. Not possible.</p>  <p>Note that the example above assumes a PCM modulation technique where each sample is codified and stored in a fixed amount of bits. As you can imagine, any other technique will suffer from this problem.</p>  <p>This post comes after today's <a href="http://www.fib.upc.es/ca/Estudis/Assignatures/SPD.html">SPD</a> class, an optional course I'm taking this semester at university. It's all about the low level details of public data networks. Amazing stuff, IMHO ;-)</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
