I've given my NetBSD talk today at the <a href="http://iparty.aditel.org/">iParty 8</a>.  The slides are now available in the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/advocacy/">advertisement material</a> section of the NetBSD web site; note that they are in Spanish.  If the talk video record is made public, I'll publish a link.  Enjoy!
