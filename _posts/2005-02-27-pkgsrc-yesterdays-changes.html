<p>It has been a while since I've done any "big" changes in <a href="http://www.pkgsrc.org/">pkgsrc</a>, basically because I've been quite busy with <a href="http://vscme.sourceforge.net/">VCS Made Easy</a> during the past month.  To make things worse, I've got back to university and there is a lot of work to do.</p>  <p>But anyway, yesterday I was able to finish two major changes I had going on.  The first one was the update of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> to 2.8.3, which was <a href="http://gnomedesktop.org/node/2163">released</a> past Wednesday. This version features several bug fixes and minor improvements, as you can expect from any minor release. Hopefully, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/start/2.9/">2.10</a> will be released in less than three weeks; but that will require a lot more of work.</p>  <p>The second one was a complete reorganization of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> packages, as I announced some days ago in another post.  Previously, there was a single and big <tt>boost</tt> package that provided almost everything (OK, there were two more, providing threading and <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> support, but they were somewhat ugly).  After the <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/pkgsrc-changes/2005/02/26/0089.html">changes</a>, you can find this:</p>  <ul>  <li><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/boost-build/"><tt>devel/boost-build</tt></a>: Provides the <tt>bjam</tt> utility, the <tt>Boost.Build</tt>'s core program.  This is just a build dependency for all the other packages.</li>  <li><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/boost-docs/"><tt>devel/boost-docs</tt></a>: Installs all documentation files; made optional because they are quite big and you can usually access them online.</li>  <li><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/boost-headers/"><tt>devel/boost-headers</tt></a>: Provides all the header files required at build time. This is also a build dependency and, due to the nature of Boost, many libraries are only required at this stage (i.e., the final program won't need any extra libraries to run).</li>  <li><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/boost-libs/"><tt>devel/boost-libs</tt></a>: Builds and installs all binary libraries in threaded form, <i>except</i> Boost.Python (to avoid a dependency on Python when not wanted).</li>  <li><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/devel/boost-python/"><tt>devel/boost-python</tt></a>: The Boost Python binary library.  This package is very similar to the one we had before, but now works.</li>  <li><a href="http://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/pkgsrc/meta-pkgs/python/"><tt>meta-pkgs/boost</tt></a>: A meta package that depends on all of the above, to ease the installation of a complete Boost suite.</li>  </ul>  <p>Furthermore, there are also some internal changes in the way the libraries are built. On the one hand, threading is always enabled; not doing so adds too much complexity and breaks Boost.Python. On the other hand, all stuff is installed unversioned; this eases <i>a lot</i> the build of programs outside pkgsrc.  You can also find some other changes, but these are, maybe, the major ones.</p>  <p>Enjoy!</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
