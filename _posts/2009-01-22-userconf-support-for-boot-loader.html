I have a machine at work, a Dell Optiplex 745, that cannot boot GENERIC NetBSD kernels.  There is a problem in one of the uhci/ehci, bge or azalia drivers that causes a lockup at boot time because of a shared interrupt problem.  Disabling ehci or azalia from the kernel lets the machine boot.  In order to do that, there are two options: either you rebuild your kernel without the offending driver, or you boot into the userconf prompt with -c and, from there, manually disable the driver at each boot.  None of the options are quite convincing.<br /><br />Of course, disabling a faulty driver is not the correct solution, but the workaround is useful on its own.  I've just added a <tt>userconf</tt> command to the boot loader and its configuration file -- <tt>/boot</tt> and <tt>/boot.cfg</tt> respectively -- so that the end user can pass random userconf commands to the kernel in an automated way.  userconf is a kernel feature that lets you change the parameters of builtin drivers and enable/disable them before the hardware detection routines are run.<br /><br />With this new feature in the boot loader, you can customize a GENERIC kernel without having to rebuild it!  Yes, modules could help here too, but we are not there yet for hardware drivers.  Note that OpenBSD has had a similar feature for a while with <tt>config -e</tt>, but they actually modify the kernel binary.<br /><br />You can check the patch out and comment about it in <a href="http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2009/01/22/msg004081.html">my post to tech-kern</a>.
