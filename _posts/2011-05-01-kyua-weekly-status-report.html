Unfortunately, I have had no time for coding this week. The only things I could do were:<div><ul><li>Fixed a few build problems on NetBSD introduced during past week's changes.</li><li>Built Kyua and ran a few tests on NetBSD/macppc (just for the joy of it).</li></ul><div>Coding has been eclipsed by the preparation of my presentation for BSDCan 2011;&nbsp;at this point, this has priority over any code changes. I'd argue that preparing the presentation is also part of the project, so some time has been invested ;-)</div><div><br /></div>More next week, hopefully, but I don't expect being able to do any big code improvements until after BSDCan.</div>
