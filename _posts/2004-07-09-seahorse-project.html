<a href="http://seahorse.sourceforge.net/">Seahorse</a> is a <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> frontend for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnupg/">GnuPG</a> utility.  This program is quite nice but, unfortunately, it has been unmaintained for a long time.  <p>I've just seen in the main page of the program that they are looking for someone to take over the project maintainership. This post is just a call for volunteers. I would like to help that project (it seems a nice way to get more involved in GNOME), but I feel I don't have the time to do it :( And it could be good to have an up-to-date program that can compete with <a href="http://devel-home.kde.org/%7Ekgpg/">kgpg</a>.</p>  <p>If you are interested, look through the <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?short_desc_type=allwordssubstr&short_desc=&amp;product=seahorse&long_desc_type=allwordssubstr&amp;long_desc=&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&amp;status_whiteboard=&keywords_type=anywords&amp;keywords=&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&emailtype1=substring&amp;email1=&emailtype2=substring&amp;email2=&bugidtype=include&amp;bug_id=&changedin=&amp;chfieldfrom=&chfieldto=Now&amp;chfieldvalue=&cmdtype=doit&amp;namedcmd=My+open+bugs&newqueryname=&amp;order=Reuse+same+sort+as+last+time&field0-0-0=noop&amp;type0-0-0=noop&value0-0-0=">list of open bugs</a>; you'll see that there are a bunch of interesting patches sitting there, waiting for integration in the project's mainstream code. This could be a good place to start if you decide to take over the project; that is, review those patches and integrate them, publishing a new version afterwards.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
