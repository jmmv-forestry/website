<p>Some time ago I talked about <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/jmmv/1323.html">how to write good bug reports</a>.  Today, I've found an essay that describes this process in great detail; you can find it <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/0.000000E+00sgtatham/bugs.html">here</a>, written by Simon Tatham.</p>  <p>Related to this, I also found an article that explains how to make good questions; i.e., to not annoy the person that may answer you - it focuses on hackers answering - and to provide enough information to make your question complete. You can find it <a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/smart-questions.html">here</a>, written by Eric S. Raymond.</p>  <p>These documents are not short, but they are worth reading, really. Even if you think you do good questions and write good bug reports, you'll surely find something in them to improve your style.</p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
