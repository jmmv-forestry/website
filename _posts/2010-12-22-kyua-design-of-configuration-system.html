Over a week ago, I mostly finished the implementation of the runtime engine for test cases of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/">Kyua</a> and, along the way, realized that it is imperative to write a configuration system right now before the configuration code becomes messier than it already is.<br /><br />To that end, I spent the last week working on a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/wiki/ConfigurationDesign">design document for the configuration system</a>. Summarizing, the document describes what the requirements for the configuration files of Kyua are, what the possible alternatives to implement them are, and advocates the use of <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> &mdash; a tiny embedded programming language &mdash; to bring these configuration files to life.<br /><br />It is your chance to get involved in the early stages of the development of Kyua! :-) Take a look at the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/kyua-discuss/browse_thread/thread/913edd8cf58567da">email to kyua-discuss asking for comments</a> and feel free to join the mailing list ;-)
