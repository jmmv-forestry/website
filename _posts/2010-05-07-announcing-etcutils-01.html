During past week, I worked on a new package called etcutils. It provides a (reduced) tool-set to programmatically manage files in <tt>/etc</tt> and is specially designed to allow pkgsrc to update <tt>/etc/shells</tt> and <tt>/etc/services</tt> in a more consistent way.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that the 0.1 release is now ready!  Go to the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/%7Ejmmv/etcutils/">etcutils web page</a> for details.  (I know that if you are a Linux user, you probably don't care about this because your distribution most likely already provides something similar... albeit more complex.)<br /><br />I'll now proceed to import this new package into pkgsrc as <tt>sysutils/etcutils</tt>.  Later on (most likely not today), the following should happen: rework pkginstall to use the new shells(8) utility to update <tt>/etc/shells</tt>, add a new feature to pkgsrc to abstract the updates to <tt>/etc/services</tt>, and swipe through pkgsrc to make all packages touching this file use the new frameworky option.  (Hey FAM, that includes you!)
