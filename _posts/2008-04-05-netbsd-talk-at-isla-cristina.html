Yesterday night, I got back from the "<a href="http://www.iesmirabent.com/jornadas/index2.html">I Jornadas Tecnológicas Isla Cristina</a>", a small technological conference organized at Isla Cristina, a little town in Huelva, Spain.<div><br /></div><div>The main organizers were the teachers of a local technical school (the IES Padre José Miravent), and they invited me to give a talk about NetBSD development.  I will <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/presentations/">publish the slides</a> soon, but I have to warn you that you will not like the source format, aka PowerPoint. Being part of the university personnel, I was given a copy of Office 2008 for Mac and I wanted to give it a serious try before judging it.  It is certainly more powerful (or easy to use) than OpenOffice Impress, but it is also a lot slower; I don't know what they have done there, but the application feels really really sluggish.</div><div><br /></div><div>Anyway, back to the point of the conference.  It has been great and surpassed all the expectations I had.  The organization was excellent, the people was very nice, the food was (very) abundant and the talks were interesting (except for a couple of exceptions).  What else could you ask for?</div><div><br /></div><div>Just as a point of fact, there were around 300 registered people, and I guess around 100 of them came to my talk (it was first hour in the morning); that's a lot more public than I have ever had before, and it was a really exciting thing.  I hope the listeners enjoyed it as much as I did.</div><div><br /></div><div>The only thing I regret was not staying there one more day (after the conference) so I could go around the town and take some cool photos.  Maybe next year :-)  Ah, speaking of next year: if you get invited to give a talk, don't think twice and accept the offer!</div>
