<br /><ul><li>Some more reading on SQLite. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-SQLite-Jay-Kreibich/dp/0596521189">Using SQLite</a> book is close to awesome; very easy to read and full of insightful tips.</li><li>Cleaned up my preliminary SQLite wrapper code. Still very incomplete, but I've bitten the bullet and decided to commit the new library as is; otherwise I'll just keep&nbsp;procrastinating. So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome <a href="http://code.google.com/p/kyua/source/detail?r=228">the new utils::sqlite module in Kyua</a>. At the moment, this just provides the barebones to open and close a database. I need to start playing around with preparing statements before I can model these in my wrapper classes. (Yes, the API structure is extremely similar to that in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lutok/">Lutok</a>.)</li></ul><div><b>Update (23:40)</b>: I sent this too early, thinking I would not have anything nice to report this week either. But as it turns out, I finally had some spare time this late evening and got a chance to submit the extremely-incomplete SQLite C++ bindings I've been toying around with. See the update above! :-)</div>
