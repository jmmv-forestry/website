<p>Do you remember the good old days (playing with your Amstrad, MSX, ...) where the screen was something like yellow on blue? You can now do this in NetBSD!</p>  <p>Starting from NetBSD 2.0G, code has been added (hmm, by me ;-) to customize the console colors as well as kernel messages from userland. Previous versions allowed the modification of kernel colors, although it had to be done by a kernel rebuild.</p>  <p>As part of the changes, I've added a <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/wscons/#colors">question</a> to the <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/wscons/">wscons FAQ</a> explaining how to do it.</p>  <p>For the impatient, to set your screen to look like an Amstrad:</p>  <pre>wsconsctl -d -w border=blue msg.default.bg=blue<br />   msg.default.fg=white msg.default.attrs=hilit</pre><p></p><p class="mobile-post"></p>
