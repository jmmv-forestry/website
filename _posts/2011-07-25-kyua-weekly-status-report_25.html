<ul><li>Finished splitting the atf-specific code from the generic structures in the engine. The engine now supports the addition of extra test interfaces with minimal effort.</li><li>Started implementing a "plain" test interface for test programs that do not use any test framework. This is to allow muxing non-atf tests into atf-based test cases, which is required in the NetBSD tree.</li></ul>
