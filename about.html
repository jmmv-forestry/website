    <p>My full name is Julio Manuel Merino Vidal but I usually go for its
    shorter form: Julio Merino.  I was born in 1984 in Barcelona, Spain, and
    spent most of my life there.  In 2009 I moved to Dublin, Ireland, for a
    couple of years and since 2011 I live in New York City with my wife and our
    two kids.</p>

    <p>The site you are in is my homepage.  This vanity site exists as a hub to
    my various online profiles and the many creations of mine so that you can
    get a quick picture of who I am and what my work looks like.  Use the top
    navigation bar to access the various sections.  If you must know, this site
    is built using the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll static content
    management system</a>, uses <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter
    Bootstrap</a> for visual styling, and
    is <a href="http://github.com/jmmv/jmmv.github.io/">hosted on
    GitHub</a>.</p>

    <p>My alias across the web is, in general, <code>jmmv</code>, which
    stands for the initials of my full name.  For those sites that
    insist on using longer usernames to prevent spam (sigh), I use other
    arbitrary combinations of my name.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer the real
thing: <a href="mailto:julio@meroh.net">julio@meroh.net</a>.  (Am I not worried
about spam by putting my address here in plain sight?  No, not really: GMail
slays it all.)</p>

<h2>About meroh.net</h2>

<p><code>meroh.net</code> is my family's domain.  The name comes from a
contraction of Merino, my last name, and Oh, my wife's last name.  Any of us can
be reached by email at <nobr><code>&lt;first-name&gt;@meroh.net</code></nobr>.</p>
