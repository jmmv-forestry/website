<p>This section of the website contains my blog, which in turn contains
all kinds of write-ups: from short announcements to long-form essays.
The latter, in particular, are sometimes republished in other sites such
as Medium so watch out for the "Posted on" links at the bottom of each
article if you would like to engage elsewhere.</p>

<p>My other blog is called <a href="http://julipedia.meroh.net/">The
Julipedia</a> though I am currently thinking of completely abandoning it
in favor of this site.  There is still a ton of valuable content in
there and I'm considering to migrate most of the useful articles here
and index them properly.  See <a
href="/blog/2015/05/24/hello-medium.html">Hello, Medium!</a> and <a
href="/blog/2016/01/28/medium-experiment-wrapup.html">The Medium
experiment wrap-up</a> for details on why.</p>
