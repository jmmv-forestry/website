My story with Windows started many years ago, back in 1993 when I got my first computer. That computer, a multimedia 386-based PC, came with Windows 3.1. Soon after that, I "upgraded" to OS/2 Warp 3 and pretty much abandoned Windows. Granted: on the next computers I had, I installed Windows 95, 98, and later 2000, only to be able to run a couple of games. OS/2, and later, Linux and BSD, were my main platforms.

Over the years, I have kept an eye on Windows: first, on the "disgusting" side, with the attitude of a teenager that just copied whatever he saw being done by the members of the Linux communities. The truth is that they were right at the time: Windows 95, 98 and ME were all pretty bad. On the other hand, NT-based systems were decent enough and XP was the first release of those to reach the masses.

At some point later, probably around 2005, I encountered The Old New Thing. This probably is one of my favorite blogs: the author, Raymond Chen, is excellent at explaining why certain things that seem dumb at first actually have a reason for their existence. Reading this blog for years, and myself having gained more expertise with software engineering in general, I have achieved a very different point of view of Windows.

Anyway: Windows hasn't been my main platform since 1994 or so. I have had one or another version installed on my machine for different reasons, and I have had significant exposure to Windows due to family support requests... but that's about it. Until recently.

A bit over a year ago, I bought an old HP Elitebook from a friend and I have used it on and off "just because". This machine is certainly underpowered: the CPU, a Core 2 Duo at X.XX, is out of balance with a poor 2 GB of RAM and a super-slow hard drive. Yet, when I installed Windows 8.1 on this machine, I was pleasantly surprised: the laptop ran pretty smoothly, specially in comparison to various Linux desktop distributions I had tried. This, and the fact that I find the recent Windows flat UI to be quite cool, made me use the machine more than ever just to experience the recent developments. In fact, I updated the machine to the Windows 10 TP builds and I have to confess that I have liked a lot what I've seen.
