<p>The experience of posting series of articles over the last couple of months has been quite gratifying.  Granted: most posts have not sparked the response I would have liked, but the cohesion of multiple related articles and the regular scheduled posting are great.</p> <p>Sincerely: I have bigger plans for my writing than this blog allows.  Two reasons.  First, because this blog has not been focused for years and all the old, disconnected content is a hinderance.  Second, and more importantly, because this is a completely personal blog (to the extreme of bundling my name in the title).  But <i>what truly matters is the content</i>.  For these reasons, this blog needs a clean face, a fresh start and its own concept: aka rebranding.  You may have noticed the recent efforts to publish regular and the various attempts to tune the visual style, and they were all going in this direction; however, they are not enough... something does not <i>feel</i> right yet.</p> <p>So what's happening!?</p> <p>Don't panic.  I am creating a <i>new</i> blog.  A blog explicitly focused on programming, Unix, a combination of both and maybe the occasional semi-related post on other technology topics.  The blog will be all about its content, and that content shall be great, interconnected and easily available.</p> <p>Enter PROGRANIX.</p> <p>See you on the other side.  The Julipedia will no longer receive regular updates and any personal writings will go to <a href="https://plus.google.com/116807652240575800029/posts">my Google+ profile</a> â€” which, sincerely, is a better fit than a blog for arbitrary musings on anything.  Make sure to <a href="TODO">register to the new blog</a> to not miss a beat.</p>
