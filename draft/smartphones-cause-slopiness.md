I used to be good at replying to emails on time. When dozens of emails came in every day, I would sort them out, and I would immediately reply, at the very least, to the ones directed to me. One or two would slip for a few days, but soon after the sought Inbox Zero was achieved again. Inbox Zero wasn't a specific goal: it "just was".

Things have changed, and I am now awful at dealing with personal email. I now go by weeks&mdash;even months&mdash;before replying to an email that was directly addressed to me and that was worth replying to. Important because it was an email from a person I care about, or important because it was an email about a project I run.

There are probably many reasons behind this change in behavior, but the one that recently struck me is rooted on my smartphone.

# Why?

Thanks to the smartphone's almost-magical abilities, I'm now connected to email 24/7. I check for new email tens of times a day, and here lies the first problem: what once was a task that happened at specific times of the day and that had focused attention, is now a task that spreads throughout the day and that overlaps other tasks.

This lack of attention is problematic: because I check email constantly, I see the same things over and over again. Subconsciously, if I do not reply to something immediately, it'll still be there a few minutes later... so no biggie, I won't miss it. (Hah.)

The second problem is with the smartphone itself. You see: I dread typing more than a trivial sentence on the smartphone; it's an exercise fraught with frustration. The on-screen keyboard is so bad that it gets things mostly right, but not really, which restrains your typing freedom. (Hint: I type in three different languages depending on who my interlocutors are, and on-screen keyboards are particularly bad at supporting this&mdash;not to mention that non-English dictionaries are... suboptimal.) The inability to multitask is also annoying: you'd think that this doesn't matter, but many times, an important email requires a link to some site, or an image, or *something* that comes from a separate app. Switching back and forth between the two is just too inconvenient.

In other words: when I see that the email requires anything more than just typing a single sentence back&mdash;and that includes having to click a link to read something&mdash;my mind automatically enters its lazy mode and says "oh no, not on this device; let's handle this later"... and the later never comes.

Combine these two and you have a recipe for disaster. Because I postpone dealing with emails until later because I think that that "later" will be soon, and because I refuse to reply to emails that require my full attention from the smartphone, the replies get postponed indefinitely.

Yes, I still check my email on my computer; it's in the background all the time (beep, another problem). But the bad practices I've gained from my smartphone have spread to my practices in front of the computer.

# What's the solution?

I don't know. I could cut email from the smartphone, but sometimes, *sometimes*, it's oh-so-handy.

Same thing for the smartphone itself: I could live without it for the most part, but I'd miss things like maps. Actually... maps are probably the only thing I would care about that is not offered by another device in the same manner. I wouldn't mind seeing all the communication aspects could go away so that I would focus on them only when I wanted to. The problem is that "wanted to" sometimes is "when on the go"&mdash;and then you do need those capabilities.

Thoughts?
